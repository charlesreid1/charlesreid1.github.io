<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Recently I discovered the wonderful blog of <a href="http://blog.jgc.org/2013/05/the-two-problems-i-had-to-solve-in-my.html">John Graham-Cumming</a>.
One of hist posts, from 2013, details a question that he had to answer for the Oxford University Department of Computer Science's "interviews" 
(which, I believe, are a kind of final examination "interview" to graduate, not an interview for admittance to the program).
Graham-Cumming describes one of the quetions he was presented with during his interview.</p>
<p><a name="z-setup"></a></p>
<h2>The Z-Machine: Setup</h2>
<p>Here is the problem setup:</p>
<p>Suppose you have a computer with a very simple memory layout. 
The memory consists of a series of numbered locations, each of which can store numbers. 
These numbers are positive or negative integers. Here is an illustration of an example of this memory layout:</p>
<p><img alt="Z Machine Memory Layout" src="https://charlesreid1.com/w/images/2/22/Z-Machine1.png"></p>
<p><a name="z-instructions"></a></p>
<h2>The Z-Machine: Instructions</h2>
<p>Z-Machine Instructions</p>
<p>The machine can only perform three instructions: Zero (Z), Increment (I), and Jump (J).</p>
<p>The <strong>Z operator</strong> zeros out a location in memory. The operation specifies which index should be zeroed out. For example, Z4 will zero out index 4 (which is the 5th item in memory, since indexing starts at 0).</p>
<p>The <strong>I operator</strong> increments the value at a location in memory by 1. The operation specifies which index should be incremented. For example, I6 will increment index 6 (the 7th item in memory) by 1.</p>
<p>The <strong>J operator</strong> compares two locations in memory. If the values are different, the jump operator will branch (that is, jump to a different location in the code). The two locations are specified when calling the operator, and an arrow (or operation number) indicates where the operator should branch TO if the values are not the same. If the values are the same, the code continues.</p>
<p>The program stops when it reaches the end of the instruction list.</p>
<p><a name="z-loop"></a></p>
<h2>Simple Example: Loop</h2>
<p>Here is an example of a loop program. This program sets memory index 4 to zero, 
then increments it until it is equal to the value in memory index 20:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>001   Z4
002   I4
003   J4,20 --&gt; 002
</pre></div>


<p>The instruction <code>J4,20 --&gt; 002</code> indicates that the values in cell 4 and cell 20 
should be compared, and if they are not equal, the machine should jump to instruction <code>002</code>.</p>
<p><a name="z-addition"></a></p>
<h2>Implementing an Addition Operation on the Z-Machine</h2>
<p>Graham-Cumming includes the following programming challenge in his <a href="http://blog.jgc.org/2013/05/the-two-problems-i-had-to-solve-in-my.html">blog post</a>:</p>
<p>Suppose a machine has two numbers in the first two locations in memory. Utilize these three operations to add the two numbers together and put the result into the third location in memory.</p>
<p>Under what circumstances does the program fail?</p>
<p><a name="z-solution-approach"></a></p>
<h3>The Solution Approach (The Maths)</h3>
<p>To approach the solution, start with the maths. What we're doing is trying to define a "complex" arithmetical operation (addition) from simpler "unit" operations (increment by one), so it will be helpful to wipe our mental slate clean and start at the very beginning of the problem.</p>
<p>When I teach a math class, whether it be a developmental math class, an algebra class, or a calculus class, I always spend the first "full" lecture by guiding the students through this very procedure. Here's how I set the tone: "Imagine that you are stranded on a desert island, with no calculators, no math books, nothing but your fingers and toes. Now suppose you are tasked with reinventing all of mathematics, entirely from scratch. How would you do it?"</p>
<p>This is a challenging task - and part of the challenge is just knowing where to begin (just how clean should you wipe the mental slate?). The Z-Machine problem formulation resolves that problem by explicitly enumerating valid operations. But let's continue with the desert island analogy for a bit.</p>
<p>If we begin at what is truly the beginning, we can start with a single unit, the number 1. (If we want to fast forward through thousands of years of human history, we can instead start with the number 0 in addition to the number 1.) Having only a single number is boring, because we can't count anything. We need a way to generate more numbers. So, we begin by defining an increment operation. We begin with the unit, 1. We declare that we can combine 1 with any other number. When we combine 1 with another 1, we get a new, larger number - which we arbitrarily call two, and represent using this funny squiggle: 2.</p>
<p>Now that we have defined the increment operation, adding a unit, we can begin to generate new numbers. We start with 1+1, which gives 2. The next number can be found by adding 1 to 2, which gives us a new number that we arbitrarily call three, and represent with a funny squiggle: 3.</p>
<p>We continue in this manner, until we reach 9, and run out of squiggles to write. The next number we will get is a special number, because it is equal to the total number of fingers. When we get to 9, and add one more, we get "two hands", which we arbitrarily call ten. If we want to keep counting beyond ten, we're stuck, because we've run out of fingers. But we can take a shortcut - we can let one toe represent "two hands". So, we hold up one toe, to represent ten. To write ten, we can let the first digit represent how many toes we are holding up, and the second digit represent how many fingers we are holding up. That means we can write our "two hands" quantity as 10 - one toe, no fingers.</p>
<p>We can keep on incrementing by 1, and using this system we can count all the way up to 99, at which point we will need another pair of hands or feet to keep generating new numbers, or we can suppose that after counting to 99, we are able to hold numbers in our head.</p>
<p>But once again, we're generating numbers slowly. We want a way to generate more numbers, faster, so we can count higher. So, we define a new addition operation. Rather than adding 1, we define the general operation of addition recursively. To add two numbers like a and b, we can define this addition in terms of a unit increment:</p>
<div class="math">$$
a + b = a + 1 + 1 + 1 + \dots + 1
$$</div>
<p>We increment the quantity a by 1, b times. This gives us a way to add arbitrary numbers together, so now we can reach much larger numbers by taking the largest number that we can count to, and adding that number to itself.</p>
<p>Extending this approach can lead us from an increment operation (performed b times) to an addition operation (<code>+b</code>).</p>
<p>It can also lead from an addition operation (performed b times) to a multiplication operation (<code>*b</code>).</p>
<p>Extending the idea further, we can apply the multiplication operation (performed b times) and obtain an exponentiation operation (<code>^b</code>).</p>
<p>This recursive definition of new operations can continue as long as we'd like: applying the exponentiation operation b times yields tetration (<code>^b^b^b^b^b...^b</code>).</p>
<p>But let's get back to addition.</p>
<p><a name="z-addition1"></a></p>
<h3>Solution 1: Positive Integers Only</h3>
<p>Adding two positive integers is the simplest case. 
Essentially, we just perform two loops: 
the first loop increments the result and increments a temporary variable 1, 
and does that until the temporary variable 1 is equal to the first number. 
The second loop increments the result and increments the result by 1 
for a number of times equal to the number at index 1.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>001   Z2                    // clear space for the result
002   Z3                    // clear space for temp variable 1
003   I2                    // increment result
004   I3                    // increment temp variable 1
005   J3,0 --&gt; 003
006   Z4                    // clear space for temp variable 2
007   I2                    // increment result
008   I3                    // increment temp variable 2
009   J4,1 --&gt; 007
010   Z3                    // clean up
</pre></div>


<p>(Because we only have an increment operation at our disposal, 
there is no way for us to deal with negative numbers. 
Dittos for non-integer real numbers.) </p>
<p>This method will fail when either of the two numbers we are adding are zero.</p>
<p><a name="z-addition2"></a></p>
<h3>Solution 2: Dealing With Zeros</h3>
<p>A second solution that is a bit more challenging is dealing with the case of possible zeros 
in the first or second position. The algorithm above will increment the result and the 
temporary variable <em>at least once</em> (similar to a do-while loop structure), 
which will always cause the comparison operation <code>J2,0</code> or <code>J3,1</code> to fail
if either cell 0 or cell 1 holds a zero.</p>
<p>Here is code that can deal more gracefully with a zero in either 
the first or second positions. This utilizes some extra space in memory
to keep track of whether index 0 is a zero and whether index 1 is a zero.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>// initialize
001     Z3
002     Z4 // temp 0
003     Z5 // temp 1
004     Z6 // is index 0 a zero?
005     Z7 // is index 1 a zero?
006     Z8 // zero
007     Z9 // one
008     I9

// increment by amount in index 0
009     J0,8 --&gt; 014
010     I6
011     J4,6 --&gt; 014
012     I4
013     I3
014     J0,4 --&gt; 009

// increment by amount in index 1
015     J1,8 --&gt; 020
016     I7
017     J7,8 --&gt; 020
018     I5
019     I3
020     J1,5 --&gt; 017

// clean up
021     Z4
022     Z5
023     Z6
024     Z7
</pre></div>


<p>The central idea behind this algorithm is, we keep incrementing the target cell while a 
condition is false, and the condition we are checking is based on a separate, independent counter.
That allows us to correctly increment (and stop incrementing) based on the two numbers 
in index 0 and index 1. 
(We don't want the final result cell to be involved in our final condition check.) </p>
<p>This pattern can also be expanded to work for adding an arbitrary number of numbers; 
one simply needs to add an additional temp variable and an additional "is zero" variable 
for each new number being added to the total, then another block of 6 statements
to increment by the amount in the given index.
The block of 6 statements checks if the number we are adding is zero, 
and if it is not, the result is incremented by that many times. </p>
<p><a name="z-decrement"></a></p>
<h2>Implementing a Decrement Operator on the Z-Machine</h2>
<p>Suppose an operator places a number into cell 0 of the Z-Machine's memory. 
We require that the Z-Machine subtract 1 from that number, and place it in cell 1. </p>
<p>The pseudocode approach here is to increment two cells in a particular order:
cell 2, which contains a sentinel value, is incremented. The program them checks if 
cell 2 is equal to cell 0. If it is not, the program increments cell 1, and repeats.
If cell 2 is equal to cell 0, the program stops before cell 1 is incremented, leaving it 
one less than the original value in cell 0.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>001   Z1            // decrement result
002   Z2            // zero
003   Z3            // one
004   I3
005   J2,3 --&gt; 007  // always false
006   I1
007   I2
008   J2,0 --&gt; 006
</pre></div>


<p>This pseudocode uses hard-coded constants (zero and one) to create a jump condition
that is always false and therefore always followed. This allows the machine to 
skip a line of code like instruction 006, and perform the increment operation 
in a staggered manner, as described above.</p>
<p><a name="z-lessthan"></a></p>
<h2>Implementing a Less Than Operator on the Z-Machine</h2>
<p>Another challenging operation to implement with the Z-Machine is a comparison operator. 
Suppose that an operator places two numbers into the first two memory positions of 
the Z-Machine. That is, index 0 contains a number A, and index 1 contains a number B. 
Supposing these numbers are both natural numbers (either 0 or positive integers), 
a comparison operator will compare the two numbers, select the smaller of the two numbers, 
and place it into the third position in memory (index 2).</p>
<p>The pseudocode approach to implement the comparison operator is to create 
a counter that start at zero, and check if it is equal to A or B 
(the numbers at index 0 and index 1). 
If we continue to increment our counter, and check if it is equal to A or B, 
and stop when it reaches either A or B, we can guarantee that we will stop 
when the counter reaches the smaller of the two numbers.</p>
<p>In order to increment the memory cell at index 2 to hold the smaller of the two numbers 
at index 0 and index 1, we can use the following Z-Machine code, 
which continually checks if the number at index 2 is equal to 
either the number at index 0 or the number at index 1, increments if false, 
and stops when true (when it reaches the smaller of the two). </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>001     Z2 // smaller of the two numbers
002     Z3 // zero
003     Z4 // one
004     I4

005     J0,2 --&gt; 007
006     J3,4 --&gt; 011
007     J1,2 --&gt; 009
008     J3,4 --&gt; 011
009     I2
010     J3,4 --&gt; 005
011     Z4
</pre></div>


<p>Note that this code successfully handles the case where either number (or both) 
is 0 or any positive integer.</p>

<h2>Who Cares? (Or, How To Build A Computer)</h2>
<p>This whole exercise may appear, at first glance, to be an exercise in trivial pursuit. 
Why bother reinventing the wheel? Isn't this nothing more than an entertaining puzzle?</p>
<p>To the contrary - the process of assembling a sequence of simple operations into a cascade of
more complex operations is precisely how computational devices are assembled from 
circuit components. For example, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_%28electronics%29">flip flop circuit</a>
utilizes a pair of NOR (negation of OR) gates to store bits. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Guidance_Computer">Apollo Guidance Computer</a>
was composed entirely of NOR gates. </p>
<p>In fact, the Apollo Guidance Computer is a fantastic example of a computational device 
constructed from a set of such simple instructions as the ones available in the Z-Machine.
A few example operations from the Wikipedia article on the Apollo Guidance Computer:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>AD (add)
    Add the contents of memory to register A and store the result in A.

INDEX
    Add the data retrieved at the address specified by the instruction 
    to the next instruction. INDEX can be used to add or subtract 
    an index value to the base address specified by the operand 
    of the instruction that follows INDEX. This method is used 
    to implement arrays and table look-ups.
</pre></div>


<p>It is not unusual for a hardware platform to have a small set of basic commands or instructions
that can be carried out, and for that set of instructions to be different from hardware platform
to hardware platform. Designing a new computational device requires the system designer
to adapt to the hardware's capabilities - not the other way around. 
For that reason, it is important to keep those engineering and puzzle-solving skills sharp.
You never know when you'll be designing a new computer device.</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>In this post we'll cover how to set up a web-hosted git server that uses Gitea,
a Github clone that is written in Go. 
While this post is not, strictly speaking, research, 
having your own hosted git server certainly makes it easier to
manage research codes and set up organizations to own different bits of code.</p>
<p>Here's an image of a git repository in the finished product:</p>
<p><img alt="Image of finished product" src="/images/gitea1.png"></p>
<p>We will start by covering the server configuration for Gitea, 
and then we'll cover how to use Gitea's git repository.</p>
<p><a name="gitea-running"></a></p>
<h2>Running with Gitea</h2>
<p>Gitea is a web app for running a self-hosted Github clone. 
It is implemented entirely in the Go language,
so all of the pages that are served up are assembled by the Go binary.
The Go binary also has a local instance of git running, 
and any actions taken through the Gitea web interface
are translated, by the Go binary, into actions in the git reopsitory.</p>
<p>Out of the box, Gitea provides all of this functionality, and takes care of all the details,
so you don't have to worry about any of this. But if you build it yourself,
you can modify the content the binary serves up and the actions it takes. </p>
<p>In this guide, we'll stick to the binary.</p>
<p><img alt="DIagram of how the gitea binary runs as an http server on port 3000." src="/images/gitea-diagram.png"></p>
<p><a name="gitea-bin"></a></p>
<h3>Binary or Source</h3>
<p>There are some problems with the source code that may make compilation from source impossible.
(See <a href="https://charlesreid1.com/wiki/Gitea#Using_Binary">charlesreid1.com wiki notes</a>.)
The binary version of Gitea is recommended. </p>
<p><a name="gitea-config-dir"></a></p>
<h3>Configuring Gitea Directories</h3>
<p>Gitea expects a certain directory organization, specifically, a folder for binaries, 
certificates, a database, git repositories, and the log.</p>
<p>The recommended arrangment is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>/path/to/www/gitea/
   \
    \---------- bin/
     \--------- certs/
      \-------- data/
       \------- repositories/
        \------ log/
</pre></div>


<p>Once the files are organized in this way, navigate to the bin directory
and (preferrably using tmux or screen to send to background) 
execute the command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>./gitea web
</pre></div>


<p>This runs a setup page on port 3000.</p>
<p>Note that you may or may not need to set your <code>$GOPATH</code> variable:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>export GOPATH=&quot;<span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">HOME</span><span class="cp">}</span>/gocode&quot;
</pre></div>


<p>Go ahead and follow the instructions on the page to get Gitea set up.
The <a href="https://gitea.io">gitea.io</a> page has good documentation.</p>
<p><a name="gitea-fw"></a></p>
<h3>Opening the Firewall</h3>
<p>Assuming your port 3000 was closed on the firewall,
and assuming you plan to run the gitea service as a public service listening on an external port, 
you will want to open your firewall to accept incoming traffic on port 3000:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># allow traffic on port 3000
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3000 -j ACCEPT
#  to allow forwarding for 3000 to internal LAN 
iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -j ACCEPT --dport 3000 -m state --state NEW
</pre></div>


<p><a name="gitea-config-server"></a></p>
<h3>Setting Up and Configuring Gitea Server</h3>
<p>To configure gitea, you will use a <code>.ini</code> configuration file contained in:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>/path/to/www/gitea/custom/conf/app.ini
</pre></div>


<p>Here is an example gitea configuration file. It starts with a header, then has sections
for different aspects like databases, the git repository, and the server:</p>

<p>Ultimately, there are many configuration examples available for Gitea,
so we won't go into any more detail on that.</p>
<p>For details on how to configure Gitea with HTTPS, see <a href="https://charlesreid1.com/wiki/Gitea">charlesreid1.com/wiki/Gitea</a>.</p>
<p>Let's move on to how we actually utilize Gitea,
and focus especially on how to make gitea work in tandem with github
and other git servers, instead of being yet another complication in the toolchain.</p>
<p><a name="gitea-use"></a></p>
<h2>How To Use Gitea</h2>
<p>As we mentioned before, the gitea binary is actually wrapping a git repo, 
and interactions with the binary (via the web) are translated into actions in that repo.
This is important to understand, since it will prevent us from thinking about 
gitea as a "centralized" server, and get us thinking about gitea as just another 
computer with a copy of the repository on it.</p>
<p>Understanding how to use gitea also requires correct thinking about how 
distributed version control works - the way that each collaborator 
with a copy of the repo can also act as a decentralized git server. 
In this way, the gitea server becomes just another git client,
with some extra frosting on top in the form of a web interface.</p>
<p><a name="gitea-pushing-local"></a></p>
<h3>Pushing a Local Repo Into Gitea</h3>
<p>If you want to move existing local repositories into gitea, it's easy.
Remember that with git, everything is local, so all you need to do 
is push a copy to gitea, and gitea will have the whole repository locally too,
including its entire history and any branches and tags that were on your local machine.
If you have remotes, you'll need to get local copies of any branches or tags you want
from that remote server (covered in more detail below).</p>
<p>The basic steps:
<em> Get everything you want locally (including branches and tags)
</em> Fetch from remotes, if you have any.
<em> Add new remote (gitea)
</em> Push to new remote</p>
<p>The end result will be a gitea repo fully-populated with the project's commit history.</p>
<p>Here are the steps in a bit more detail:</p>
<p>Start by creating a git repository, or cloning an existing one:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mkdir my_git_repo/
cd my_git_repo
git init .
</pre></div>


<p>or</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git clone http://github.com/mot_pesli/coune_car
</pre></div>


<p>Next, create an empty git repo on the gitea server.
Sign in using a gitea username and password. 
There will be a plus sign in the upper right,
just like on Github. Click the plus sign, and choose create new repo.
Enter the repo name, and a description.
Make sure the repo will NOT automatically create
a readme or a LICENSE file, as we will be importing all files
from another repo anyway.</p>
<p>Once you've got a local copy of the repo with everything you want to push,
and you have an empty repository on the gitea server ready for commits,
add the gitea repository as a new remote to your local repository.</p>
<p>Example: suppose you have a gitea user named <code>zappa</code> who has created a new empty repo 
named <code>linol-aquabus</code> on the gitea server. 
Zappa would then cd to the local copy of the git repo,
and add the gitea repository's url as a new remote called <code>gitea</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git remote add gitea https://git.mydomain.com/zappa/linol-aquabus.git

# alternatively,

git remote add gitea https://mydomain.com:3000/zappa/linol-aquabus.git
</pre></div>


<p>Now Zappa can push the entire commit history of the current repo
to the gitea remote git server:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git push origin gitea

# alternatively,

git push --all origin gitea
</pre></div>


<p>If Zappa now visits <code>mydomain.com:3000/zappa/linol-aquabus</code> the entire
contents of the repository and its commit history in gitea's web interface
will be available for browsing.</p>
<p><a name="gitea-copying"></a></p>
<h3>Copying Repos from Gitub to Gitea</h3>
<p>The process for copying Github repositories to Gitea follows the above procedure closely:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
</pre></div>


<p>Check out any branches or tags you may want to push to gitea.</p>
<p>Then add the gitea remote to the repo:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git remote add gitea https://git.mydomain.com/zappa/linol-aquabus.git
</pre></div>


<p>Now push the contents of the local repository to the remote gitea repository:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git push origin gitea
</pre></div>


<p>Once this command is executed, the gitea remote will have the entire commit history of the repo,
which it will render and display through its web interface. Thus, the entire commit history
will be immediately available to browse through gitea.</p>
<p>(Note that information about Github issues or Github user profiles is not stored in the git repo,
just as Gitea comments and Gitea user profiles are not stored in the git repo.)</p>
<p><img alt="Gitea and Github - same repo, side by side." src="/images/gitea-n-github.png"></p>
<p><a name="gitea-moving"></a></p>
<h3>"Moving" Repos from Gitub to Gitea</h3>
<p>First, it should be stated up front that you do not have to choose 
between gitea and github - you can have a copy of a repo on both,
frequently push to one or the other, and occasionally update the other
as a kind of "mirror."</p>
<p>If you do want to <em>move</em> a repo from github to gitea,
remember that github does not "own" the repo,
so what you're actually doing is deleting the copy of your repo 
that lives on github's server.</p>
<p>To move the repo, all you have to do is copy it from github to somewhere else
(whether it be your local computer, or to the gitea server), then delete it from github.
You will not lose any information about the git repository history.
Github does not keep/store that information - git does.</p>
<p><a name="gitea-pushing-commits"></a></p>
<h3>Where to Push Commits: Github or Gitea?</h3>
<p>It may seem confusing to use multiple repositories side-by-side,
but this is precisely how the designers of git intended it to be used - 
for decentralized version control.</p>
<p>That means Github or Gitea are not "centralized" servers that "own" the repository,
they are merely another instance of git, running on a server, with a local copy of the repo.</p>
<p>Accordingly, if your project exists as a repo on gitea and as a repo on github, 
it is like the project existing as a repo on your hard drive and as a repo on your collaborator's hard drive -
there is no contradiction. If you make changes to your local copy of the repo, you can commit those changes,
then push the commits to someone else. In the same way, you can make changes to your local copy of the repo 
and commit those changes, then push the commits to either gitea, or github, or both - wherever you want.</p>
<p><a name="gitea-backing-up"></a></p>
<h3>Backing Up Gitea</h3>
<p>It's important to say a few words about backups.</p>
<p>Because Gitea is configured (with the above config file) to use sqlite,
it stores its entire database (the extra "frosting" of stars, wiki pages,
issues, user pictures, etc.) in a single file on disk, in the <code>data/</code> directory
of the gitea installation.</p>
<p>The git repository is, similarly, a single file on disk, with the entire database 
of commits, blogs, commit histories, etc., all contained in the <code>.git</code> directory,
which is contained in the <code>repositories</code> directory of the gitea installation.</p>
<p>That means backing up your git server is as easy as copying the gitea folder.
No need to back up a MySQL database or do a funny pants dance to export your database
to a proprietary format. </p>
<p>This is another central tenent of git's design philosophy - 
be fast, pack light, and travel easily.</p>
<p><a name="gitea-patterns"></a></p>
<h2>How Gitea Fits Into Git Patterns</h2>
<p>There are <a href="https://charlesreid1.com/wiki/Git_Resources">many resources on git</a>,
and some cover the concept of "git patterns," 
or templates for how to use git.</p>
<p>Because git is designed to be decentralized, 
gitea provides a "centralized" node for collaboration
within a decentralized system.
So you could use gitea to collaborate with 
your local Team A, and push and pull branches 
and work on various features together.
Then, once Team A has put together a branch they've found useful,
they can push it to a different remote server that is more widely accessed.</p>
<p>(Note that this is the logic behind why you need to 
check out all the branches and tags, <em>locally</em>, that you want to push 
to the gitea remote server - this allows you the flexibility to 
only share select branches, so that you might have 
some branches shared in common wth gitea and github,
and other branches only existing on gitea.)</p>
<p>Team B and Team C may use github, and not gitea, to access the project code.
The gitea server may for example be a private server on a local network,
whereas github is better suited for collaboration.
By pushing select branches from the Team A git server, gitea,
to the github server, Team B and Team C will then be able to 
access them from github.</p>
<p>You could also have multiple gitea/gitlab/github enterprise servers 
for multiple organizations running on git, and they could share a code base 
by sharing git repositories, commit histories, branches, and so on.</p>
<p><a name="gitea-wrapup"></a></p>
<h2>Wrapup</h2>
<p>Have a look at the <a href="http://gitea.io">Gitea project</a>, <a href="https://golang.org">the Go language</a>,
<a href="https://git-scm.com">git</a>, <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> for all the nice software
that made this possible. </p>
<p>Then have a look at the finished product at <a href="https://git.charlesreid1.com">git.charlesreid1.com</a>.</p>
<p>Gitea allows you to create organizations, useful for organizing repos related to 
particular functionality or platforms. For example, <a href="https://charlesreid1.com:3000/rpi">rpi</a> 
is an organization that owns repositories with scripts and software for raspberry pis,
<a href="https://charlesreid1.com:3000/docker">docker</a> is an organization that owns repositories
with Dockerfiles, and <a href="https://charlesreid1.com:3000/mac">mac</a> holds Mac-related things.</p>
<p>This organization allows better organization of project code - a dotfiles repository
that works for a Mac laptop or a Unix server is not necessarily good for a Raspberry Pi
or a Docker container, so code is organized accordingly.</p>
<p>Organizations can also be used to organize project-level code. 
This git repo is in its beginning phases, but has great potential
as a great tool that makes git even more functional and provides 
one more reason to switch to git.</p></div>

<h2>Before We Begin: The Code</h2>
<p>Note that all of the code discussed/shown in this post is available from the 
traveling salesperson problem repository on <a href="https://charlesreid1.com:3000/charlesreid1/tsp">git.charlesreid1.com</a>.
The <code>guava/</code> directory contains the guava solution to the traveling salesperson problem,
along with the timing scripts discussed below, and several example output files.</p>
<p><a name="better-timing-intro"></a></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Timing a piece of code can be tricky. </p>
<p>Choosing a random problem of a given size can be problematic,
if you happen to randomly chose a particularly easy or difficult case.
This can lead to an inaccurate picture of scale-up behavior.
Timing results should be statistically averaged - the figure below
shows scale-up behavior for the traveling salesperson problem
when solving a single random problem, versus a hundred random problems.</p>
<p><img alt="Average versus one-time solutions, walltime versus problem size." src="/images/avg-vs-onetime-walltime.png"></p>
<p>This post will cover some conceptual and code tools 
for measuring the timing and performance of code.</p>
<p><a name="better-timing-timing"></a></p>
<h2>Timing Scripts</h2>
<p>Timing a piece of code is a task that sounds simple, on its face.
However, the task of profiling code quickly balloons 
from a single timing of a single bit of code 
to running hundreds of cases, juggling output from each run,
and stitching together script upon script.
Soon you find yourself swimming in a pool of output files,
looking for your scripts...</p>
<p>In this post we'll cover a workflow for timing a piece of Java code
that will help give you a method for thinking about timing.
This also balances the need for practicality
(i.e., just get it done in as simple a manner as possible)
with good design 
(i.e., flexible inputs and the use of scripts).</p>
<h2>Before You Time: Developing Your Algorithm</h2>
<p>As you develop your algorithm, you may have variable values hard-coded 
and random number generators seeding from the same value each time.
The intention, as you are developing, is to work out the bugs
without the additional difficulty of solving a different problem
each time you run the program.</p>
<h2>Beginning Your Timing Journey</h2>
<p>Once you've implemented your algorithm and verified that it works,
the timing portion begins. You can time the code using mechanisms
built into the language, which is the most accurate way of 
timing code. This is called <em>instrumenting</em> your code.
To begin with, you might try timing a single problem size, 
but this information is hard to interpret without more data,
so you start to time the code on problems of other sizes.</p>
<p>Here there be dragons.</p>
<h2>Statistical Timing, a.k.a., If You Give A Mouse A Cookie</h2>
<p>See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_You_Give_a_Mouse_a_Cookie"><em>If You Give A Mouse A Cookie</em></a>.</p>
<p>Once you time the code solving a single problem,
you will want to time the code solving multiple problems.</p>
<p>Once you time the code solving multiple problems,
you will want to time the code solving each problem multiple times 
to get an accurate statistical picture of the solution time on a variety of problems.</p>
<p>Once you get statistics about multiple problem times,
you will want to gather statics about variations in problem types and algorithm variations.</p>
<p>It simply does not end. A strategy for managing this deluge of new timing needs 
prevents spaghetti code.</p>
<h2>Hierarchical Timing Strategy</h2>
<p>The strategy here is to design code and scripts that are <em>hierarchical</em>.
The levels of the hierarchy consist of the different scopes involved in timing:
<em> Single problem/program/binary
</em> Multiple problem/program/binary
<em> Statistical averages using case matrix
</em> Design of Computer Experiments: Testing Variations 
* Strong and weak scaling (if we decide to continue with parallelization of algorithm)</p>
<p>At each stage, we utilize scripts to bundle the task into a single command or script.</p>
<h2>Single Problem/Program/Binary: Makefile</h2>
<p>At the scale of solving a single problem, we need a tool that will 
compile and run Java code - even if it only happens once.
Makefiles are an excellent tool for stringing together commands with flags 
(in the case of the traveling salesperson problem,
we need to link to the Guava Jars when we compile and run).</p>
<p>By defining some variables at the top of the Makefile, 
and a few rules, we have a functional and easy way to build code 
with scalable complexity:</p>

<p>For running single cases and gathering small amounts of (initial) timing data,
Makefiles greatly simplify the workflow.</p>
<h2>Multiple Program/Problem/Binary: Bash</h2>
<p>Bash is a faithful scripting language that makes it easy to do 
simple mechanical tasks like run commands in for loops,
necessary for the next level of complexity in our timing hierarchy.</p>
<p>While the task at hand is simple enough, and we could easily use Makefiles, 
we'll use a separate Bash script for separate functionality 
and keep things from getting overly complicated in the Makefile.</p>
<p>The essence of the timing script is combining the <code>make time</code> command,
which takes a size parameter, with bash for loops.</p>
<p>Here is a stripped down version of the timing script:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>make build 

for N in 4 5 6 7 8
do
    make time SIZE=<span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="cp">}</span> 
done
</pre></div>


<p>That's it... The rest is just printing!</p>
<p>The <code>make time</code> command passes the size argument on the command line.
The Java Traveling Salesperson Problem code checks if there is an input argument on the command line,
and if there is it uses that as the problem size.</p>
<p>Here's a more embellished script:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>export RIGHTNOW=&quot;`date +&quot;%Y%m%d_%H%M%S&quot;`&quot;
export OUT=&quot;timeout_tsp_java_<span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">RIGHTNOW</span><span class="cp">}</span>.out&quot;
touch <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">OUT</span><span class="cp">}</span>
cat /dev/null &gt; <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">OUT</span><span class="cp">}</span>

<p>In this way we can run a quick test matrix of different problem sizes,
and see how the code scales.</p>
<h2>Statistical Averaging</h2>
<p>Of course, any good computational physicist will tell you that scaling behavior
extrapolated from running a single case of a single problem size is folly - 
your random choice of graph could have been an unusually easy or difficult graph,
throwing off the results of the timing. </p>
<p>A proper scaling study really needs to take into account the statistical trends 
in solution time on a random assortment of problems, 
so we need a way of scripting solutions to dozens or hundreds of random problems 
and computing statistically representative measures of code performance.</p>
<p>Our code implements a function to generate random graphs, 
but for testing and debugging purposes the random number generator 
was seeded with the same value each time. By making the random number generators
truly random, each problem we solve will be a different random graph
with the specified number ofn odes.</p>
<p>We can accomplish all of this using bash again: within the for loop over different problem sizes,
we will add a for loop for repetitions.
Here is the basic framework:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>make build 

for N in {4..10..1}
do
    for repetition in {0..100..1}
    do
        make time SIZE=<span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="cp">}</span> 
    done
done
</pre></div>


<p>And the embellished version that prints the resulting timing information to a file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># Compile
make build 

export RIGHTNOW=&quot;`date +&quot;%Y%m%d_%H%M%S&quot;`&quot;

    touch <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">OUT</span><span class="cp">}</span>

    echo &quot;**************************************&quot; &gt;&gt; <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">OUT</span><span class="cp">}</span>
    echo &quot;Running TSP with <span class="nv">$N</span> nodes with Java...&quot; &gt;&gt; <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">OUT</span><span class="cp">}</span>

        make time SIZE=<span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="cp">}</span> &gt;&gt; <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">OUT</span><span class="cp">}</span> 2&gt;<span class="err">&amp;</span>1

<p>Now we have a Makefile that allows us to build and run with a single command,
and a bash script that loops over each problem size and runs a set of computations
for each problem size. But how to compute an average?</p>
<p>We have an assortment of choices - Python being the most obvious - but in the spirit of
old-school Unix tools like make, cat, grep, and wc, let's use <code>awk</code> to compute the average 
walltime for each case size.</p>

<p>we want to extract two things: 
the first is the problem size (contained in the filename),
and the second is the column of numbers.</p>
<p>We can extract the problem size from the filename using sed,
by searching for the pattern <code>_8.out</code> or <code>_10.out</code>. 
Here is a Bash one-liner that does this for a variable <code>$f</code> 
containing the filename:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    N=$(echo $f | sed &#39;s/^.*_\([0-9]\{1,\}\).out/\1/&#39;)
</pre></div>


<p>The next thing we wnat to do is extract the column of timing data.
This is a good task for the <code>cut</code> utility. We can pass it two flags,
<code>-d</code> to tell it what to use as a field delimiter, and <code>-f</code> to tell it which field
(column) to return. To extract the third column,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    cat $f | grep &quot;Elapsed&quot; | cut -d&quot; &quot; -f3 
</pre></div>


<p>This command results in a series of floating point numbers. If we can pipe it to a program
that can do simple math, like <code>awk</code>, we can compute an average (which is pretty simple math).</p>
<p>Since <code>awk</code> is a text-proecssing program that happens to be able to interpret numbers as numbers,
we have to think like a text processing program. To compute an average, we accumulate the sum
of each line in the file, using an accumulator variable. When we have gone through each line in the file,
we divide this cumulative sum by the number of lines in the file.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    cat $f | grep &quot;Elapsed&quot; | cut -d&quot; &quot; -f3 | awk &#39;{a+=$1} END{print a/NR}&#39;
</pre></div>


<p>This one-liner uses two important concepts in <code>awk</code>, the first is the bracketed blocks <code>{}</code> 
some denoted with <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code>, and the second is the set of built-in variables available in <code>awk</code>.</p>
<p>By surrounding statements by brackets, we denote a block of statements to be run together as the main body of the program.
If the bracket is prefixed by <code>BEFORE</code>, this block of statements is run once at the beginning of the program.
If the bracket is prefixed by <code>END</code>, this block of statements is run once at the end of the program.
To compute an average, the main body of the program is to accumulate a cumulative sum variable. 
The <code>END</code> block, run once at the end, is to divide this cumulative sum by the total number of lines.</p>
<p>Finally, these values can be assigned to Bash variables using <code>$(cmd)</code> syntax:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    export N=$(echo <span class="nv">$f</span> | sed &#39;s/^.*_\([0-9]\{1,\}\).out/\1/&#39;)
    export AVG=$(cat <span class="nv">$f</span> | grep &quot;Elapsed&quot; | cut -d&quot; &quot; -f3 | awk &#39;{a+=$1} END{print a/NR}&#39;) 
    echo &quot;Average time : <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="cp">}</span>-node TSP problem : <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">AVG</span><span class="cp">}</span> s&quot;
</pre></div>


<p>Here is the final script, which loops over all of the output files
generated by the statistical average timing script,
which runs 10-100 cases per problem size:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="ch">#!/bin/sh</span>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The figure below shows the results of the timing study when using the average of 100 different random problems, 
compared to the timing study performed using a single problem size.</p>
<p><img alt="Average versus one-time solutions, walltime versus problem size." src="/images/avg-vs-onetime-walltime.png"></p>
<p>The results show dramatically different behavior, highlighting the importance
of computing the statistical average of solution walltime for many different problems.
This was not an issue that arose in discussing timing or profiling of codes to solve the 
8 queens problem, because in that case the problem (and resulting decision tree)
were determined by the choice of algorithm.</p>
<p>This information is also important ot keep in mind when comparing the timing performance 
of two algorithms - using many cases to compare two algorithms is preferrable,
since it reduces the likelihood of randomly selecting a problem that highights 
a weakness of one algorithm or a strength of the other.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this post we covered some scripting tools that make timing a lot easier to do,
and some ways of thinking about and building up scripts 
to allow for more complex timing studies without an increase 
in the associated post-processing work involved.</p>
<p>We showed how to use <code>make</code> and a Makefile to create compact, expressive commands to build and run Java programs.
We showed how to use Bash scripting to implement loops and run a case matrix of problems of various sizes,
measuring timing data for hundreds of problems in total.
All of these scripts made heavy use of Unix command line tools, 
demonstrating how to chain commands and functionality together on the command line to accomplish complex tasks.
Finally, we showed how to use the <code>awk</code> programming language to compute the average of a set of numbers,
exploring yet another application of this unusually handy language.</p></div>
