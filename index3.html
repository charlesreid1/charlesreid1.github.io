        <div class="entry-content"><h2>Learning Go with Rosalind</h2>
<h3>What is Rosalind?</h3>
<p>Rosalind.info is a website with programming challenges, similar in spirit
to <a href="https://charlesreid1.com/wiki/Project_Euler">Project Euler</a>, but with
a focus on bioinformatics. </p>
<p>Problems in the bioinformatics track are presented grouped by chapter,
with several problems per chapter. The problems are designed like a coding
competition, with problems providing structured input files and expecting
structured output from each calculation. Each time you solve a problem, a
unique input is generated, and you have a time limit in which to run your
code to solve the problem.</p>
<h3>What is Go?</h3>
<p>Go is a programming language that is static, compiled, and concurrent.
It is essentially intended as a modern replacement to C and C++, and is
designed for more modern hardware, networks, and scale of code projects.</p>
<p>Go is a language that was invented in Google. It provides some very
powerful features, and its design for concurrency is the primary feature
that motivated me to learn Go. See 
<a href="https://blog.golang.org/concurrency-is-not-parallelism">this Go blog post</a>
on "Concurrency is not parallelism" for a more in-depth discussion of
Go's concurrency design, and how that is different from (and more general
and more powerful than) parallelism.</p>
<h2>Initial Impression of Go</h2>
<p>My initial impression of Go has been positive thus far.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>The first thing about Go that I will remark on is the syntax - it 
is unusual because it reverses the order that most programming languages
use for variable and type declarations. </p>
<p>For example, in Java, you declare an integer array like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>public int[5] arr;
</pre></div>


<p>while in Go, you would declare an analogous data structure like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var arr [5]int
</pre></div>


<p>While this reversal is a bit confusing at first, it is different enough 
from other languages that it easily sticks in your head - which is actually
a welcome change from the stew of slightly-different-but-largely-overlapping 
syntax occurring across common programming languages.</p>
<p>Go also shares many of the features that make Python such an easy language
to use, including lack of semicolons (yay!) and a useful selection of built-in
methods. </p>
<h3>Godoc</h3>
<p>One of the handiest features of Go is <code>godoc</code>, a command-line utility that runs
a local web server at <code>http:8080</code> that serves up Go documentation. This includes
documentation for the standard Go library, as well as documentation for any
libraries found in the Go PATH.</p>
<h3>Environment Variables</h3>
<p>Speaking of the Go PATH, one confusing thing about getting started with Go is
all of the environment variables that must be set for Go to find various things.</p>
<p>Basically, you need to have two directories for Go: the location of your Go tree,
and the directory where you store Go packages and executables.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>$GOROOT</code> refers to the location of your Go tree. For example, this might be the
  directory <code>~/go</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>$GOPATH</code> refers to the location where your Go packages and executables are stored.
  For example, this might be <code>~/work</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these variables should be set in your <code>~/.profile</code>.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://charlesreid1.com/wiki/Go/Installing#Paths">Go/Installing</a> on the 
charlesreid1 wiki for coverage of getting set up with Go.</p>
<h3>Arrays and Slices</h3>
<p>The first concept in Go that threw me off was the concept of arrays versus slices.
This was principally due to the poor explanation and choice of examples given on the
Go blog post on how slices work.</p>
<p>Arrays are chunks of memory that are set aside to store contiguous slots for data.
To create an array, its size must be known in advance, making them less useful
in practice. To resize an array, a new array must be created, and the old array
copied into the new array.</p>
<p>Slices, on the other hand, can be thought of as tiny data structures
containing pointers to array data. Slices can easily be resized by changing the
data structure, without changing the underlying data.</p>
<p>There are also built-in <code>make()</code> and <code>copy()</code> functions, to allocate slices
that have a specified capacity (or none, in which case the slice has a variable 
size) and copy data from arrays to slices or from slice to slice.</p>
<p>The confusion around such a fundamental data type makes Go more difficult to learn
and to intuit about what's going on. While Go is clearly superior to C and Java
in many ways, it also has some unfortunate stumbling blocks in its most basic
data structure that many early learners are sure to have trouble with.</p>
<h2>Learning a New Language</h2>
<p>One of the things that stood out to me while learning Go was how different it was
from learning a non-language systems technology (library) like Docker or docker-compose, 
or Ansible. </p>
<p>When you are learning a second or third programming language, you generally have a
mental roadmap of concepts, and how they fit together and build upon each other.
Furthermore, you already know, before ever starting to learn the language, what
that roadmap of concepts generally looks like, from your prior learnings.</p>
<p>(If you pick up and compare any dozen books on various programming languages, 
you'll find certain core concepts that are repeated from book to book.)</p>
<p>Compare this with a technology like Ansible, an extremely powerful Python library
that is used for automation of IT and compute infrastructure. While extremely powerful,
Ansible is also extremely complex, and feels bewildering to learn because
it requires all users (including seasoned experts in Unix shell scripting), to 
re-learn an entirely new way of doing things using Ansible's system of modules 
and YAML syntax.</p>
<p>Ansible has no conceptual roadmap. The Ansible documentation moves somewhat
haphazardly through the many topics that must be covered but that don't fit
together.  Books that cover Ansible often follow the documentation's
organization, or have a similarly confused organization of concepts.
There is no denying it's a great piece of software, but it is very difficult
to reason about and teach compared to a computer language.</p>
<h2>Core Concepts</h2>
<p>The first few Rosalind problems from Chapter 1
were an excellent warm-up to get to know Go,
since the tasks were relatively easy and the
main bit to work out was how to use the data
structure correctly, rather than the algorithm.</p>
<p>Three data structures that we ended up utilizing 
to solve the Chapter 1 challenges using Go were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hash maps</li>
<li>Strings</li>
<li>Bit vectors</li>
</ul>
<p>More coverage of how these data structures work in Go,
plus details of how we used them to solve Rosalind
probelms, to follow in the next blog post.</p></div>

        <div class="entry-content"><h2>Flask + ILLO = Flaskadillo</h2>
<p>On October 15, 2018, I had the opportunity to 
offer an in-lab learning opportunity (ILLO) at the 
<a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/">Lab for Data Intensive Biology</a>.
The ILLO focused on Flask, a useful Python library
for creating and running web servers. This
library is useful because it has a very low
learning curve, but also has the complexity to
handle complicated, real-world projects.</p>
<p>As a part of this in-lab learning opportunity, 
I created repository with five simple Flask examples
to highlight five useful capabilities of Flask.</p>
<p>The repository is called flaskadillo and it is 
available on <a href="https://git.charlesreid1.com/charlesreid1/flaskadillo/">git.charlesreid1.com</a>
or on <a href="https://github.com/charlesreid1/flaskadillo">github.com</a>.</p>
<p>The five capabilities covered by the examples in 
flaskadillo are listed below:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>hello - hello world flask server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>api - a simple API server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>jinja - a simple Flask server that makes use of Jinja templates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>package - a simple demonstration of how to package flask apps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tests - a simple demonstration of how to write Flask tests</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example 1: Hello World</h2>
<p>We'll just cover example 1 here, but similar materials
are available for all five examples.</p>
<p>Example 1 consists of a simple flask app, <code>simple.py</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">flask</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Flask</span>
<span class="n">app</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Flask</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="vm">__name__</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="nd">@app.route</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;/&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hello</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Hello World!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <a href="https://git.charlesreid1.com/charlesreid1/flaskadillo/src/branch/master/hello">hello</a>
directory of the flaskadillo repo covers how to 
install the necessary packages and run the Flask
application.</p>
<p>There is also a unit test, <code>test_simple.py</code>, which demonstrates
how to write tests for Flask applications. To run the unit
test, run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pytest
</pre></div>


<h2>More Information</h2>
<p>For instructions on each of the 5 examples, 
visit each of the 5 directories in the 
<a href="https://github.com/charlesreid1/flaskadillo">flaskadillo repository</a>.</p>
<h3>Why flaskadillo?</h3>
<p>Because armadillo.</p>
<h3>Why armadillo?</h3>
<p>The word armadillo means "little armoured one" in Spanish.</p>
<p>Armadillos are related to anteaters and sloths (all are in the Xenartha superorder).</p>
<p>The Aztecs called them turtle-rabbits.</p></div>

        <div class="entry-content"><h2>Background: a bit about the Data Commons</h2>
<p>It has been a productive but busy summer at the
<a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/">Lab for Data Intensive Biology</a>.</p>
<p>As part of my job, I am supporting a lot of websites
and infrastructure for the <a href="https://public.nihdatacommons.us">Data Commons Pilot Phase
Consortium (DCPPC)</a>,
which wrapped up Phase 1 this month.</p>
<p>The Data Commons is a large-scale effort to establish
a community-driven set of standards for interoperability
for biological data and computation, a massive effort and
a broad mandate that has the potential to enable breakthrough
research that is currently impossible because data and computations
cannot inter-operate between the data, compute resources, and 
domain expertise that are provided by universities, hospitals, 
research institutes, companies, nonprofits, and citizen 
scientists.</p>
<h2>Informationally challenged: Data Commons growing pains</h2>
<p>An important part of defining a community-driven set of standards is defining a
community, and toward that end the collective members of the Data Commons 
met at monthly face-to-face workshops to iterate tightly on a set of
technologies and standards that will allow each institution's different compute
platforms or data banks to use other institutions' platforms or data banks.
Doing this requirs fostering community and creating the right environment
for people to work through the issues. </p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges we faced in fostering a community
that could develop and implement a set of standards across such 
a large and diverse group of experts and institutes was coordinating
information. Specifically, making sure that decisions were properly
communicated to the appropriate parties, that important documents
made their way to the entire consortium, and that documents that were
created and edited also be findable and sharable.</p>
<p>This problem began, back in April, as a very small trash fire.
People were getting used to the Github workflow and did not know
how to find the appropriate repository for the information they
needed to contribute, and consortium members were universally annoyed
that Google Drive's search functionality was so terrible.</p>
<p>In June we rolled out a trial document-tagging system to the consortium,
to deafening silence - no one was impressed or satisfied with the tagging
system. The real problem was with search.</p>
<p>Toward that end, I implemented a full-fledged search engine for the Data
Commons that utilized various third-party APIs (Github, Google Drive,
Groups.io, etc.) to index content related to the project, and make it
full-text-searchable.</p>
<p>The result was <a href="https://github.com/charlesreid1/centillion">centillion</a>,
the Data Commons search engine. This search engine provides a portal
to search for Data Commons-related Google Drive documents, Github issues,
Github pull requests, Github files, Groups.io email threads, and more.</p>
<p>Our story picks up with centillion.</p>
<h2>Presenting centillion, the Data Commons search engine</h2>
<p>One of the tools I have made heavy use of in support of
web infrastructure for the DCPPC project is Flask, a Python
library for running a web server. Flask is a very powerful
library, but it starts with a relatively simple premise:
Flask lets you create a web appplication that will bind
to a particular port, and you can then add "routes" 
that are endpoints a user can visit, like <code>/hello/world</code>,
and link those routes to Python functions.</p>
<p>On Monday 2018-10-28 the DIB Lab's weekly lab meeting featured
yours truly covering the topic of <a href="https://github.com/charlesreid1/centillion">centillion</a>,
the Data Commons search engine.</p>
<p>centillion makes use of the Python library
<a href="https://whoosh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html">whoosh</a>
under the hood, to provide search functionality, while the web 
front-end uses Flask to connect Python functions to a website 
that users can interact with.</p>
<p><img alt="Screen shot of the centillion search engine (2018-10-27)." src="images/centillion.png"></p>
<p><strong>Screen shot of the centillion search engine (2018-10-27).</strong></p>
<h2>centillion architecture: the short version</h2>
<p>As of version 1.7, centillion is packaged as a Python package.
The centillion package consists of two submodules, corresponding
to the Flask frontend and Whoosh backend, respectively: <code>webapp</code>
and <code>search</code>.</p>
<h3>webapp submodule</h3>
<p><code>centillion.webapp</code> implements the Flask app and defines all
routes. When the user runs a search, it passes the query string
on to a <code>Search</code> object from the <code>search</code> submodule. The <code>webapp</code>
submodule does not know anything about the details of the 
search engine or search index.</p>
<p>This submodule is located in <code>src/webapp/</code> in the 
<a href="https://github.com/charlesreid1/centillion">centillion repo</a>.</p>
<h3>search submodule</h3>
<p><code>centillion.search</code> implements a search engine using Whoosh,
a programming library for building search engines. Whoosh does not
implement any kind of front end, so its role is restricted entirely
to the back end.</p>
<p>The search submodule also handles interfacing with the Github, Google,
and Groups.io APIs and translating the results of API calls from these
services into documents whose contents can be extracted and indexed 
by Whoosh.</p>
<p>This submodule is located in <code>src/search/</code> in the 
<a href="https://github.com/charlesreid1/centillion">centillion repo</a>.</p></div>
