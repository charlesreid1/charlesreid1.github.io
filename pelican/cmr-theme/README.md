# CMR Theme

This theme provides templates for charlesreid1.

The way it works is, I create the main landing pages for projects/about/consulting/writing.
These landing pages may use the theme templates, or may not - whatever it wants.
This gives me maximum customizability for the charlesreid1.com site.

This does sacrifice some flexibility with the theme (meaning, we aren't really
making a re-usable theme, we're just making a theme with some pieces we can use.)
The payoff, of course, is that we get maximum flexibility.
