# Summary

* Each team has different workflows - defer to your team first, and if you haven't
  worked out how to deal with issues that come up, talk it through!

* Pushing to remotes is like publishing - it can be complicated to change commits,
  so only push when you're ready to publish.

* Pull often, push carefully - make use of local throwaway branches to test out
  how branches do when integrated together.

* To keep pull requests clean of work that is not yours, create a local throwaway
  integration branch where you merge master into your feature branch, and test out
  how the integration goes, but don't include that merge commit in the pull request
  branch, to keep the pull request work clearly differentiated.
