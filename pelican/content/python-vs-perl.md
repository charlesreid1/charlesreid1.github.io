## Summary


<a name="background"></a>

## Background 

Revisiting the N queens problem, this time implementing the solution in Python.

Verb-oriented solution, functional, and based on Perl solution

More fair comparison - both are interpreted languages, not compiled languages

Compare Python and Perl, ease of implementation, speed, flexibility

## N Queens Problem

As a recap from the last post about the N queens problem, we're solving a chess puzzle that asks:
how many different configurations are there for placing $N$ queens on an $N \times N$ chessboard
such that no queen attacks any other queen?

This is a popular problem in computer science because solutions often implement recursive backtracking.

See [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N_Queens_Problem) for details.

## N Queens Solution

Here is the pseudocode of the N queens solution being implemented here:

```
explore(column):
    if last column:
        # base case
        add to solutions
    else:
        # recursive case
        for each row:
            if this is a safe row:
                place queen on this row
                explore(column+1)
                remove queen from this row
```

This solution implements recursive backtracking to explore choices of where to place each queen.
It keeps solutions simple, and can be implemented using only primitive built-in data types.
Solutions are stringified version of these arrays, consisting of 8 digits, so they are likewise very simple.

### Perl Solution

As a reminder, the Perl solution was originally from [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/N-queens_problem#Perl).
Here's another link to the Perl solution on Github.

### Python Solution

The solution requires the use of one array of data that is fixed in size,
which for a given column stores a list of rows already occupied by queens, 
and one array of data that is variable in size, which stores where each queen has been placed.

The Python solution makes use of lists by using a fixed-size list for the occupied rows
and a variable size list for storing queen locations. 
It utilizes buit-in methods for the list data type to append and pop, or add and remove items from the end of the list.

The results of this test show that Python and Perl
are fairly closely matched.

## Perl Profiling 

Results of profiling the Perl code with `Devel::NYTProf` were detailed in a prior post.

Here are those results once again,
for the 11 queens problem:

## Python Profiling

The Python N queens solution was profiled with two tools: `cProfile` and `line_profiler`. 

The built-in profiling tool `cProfile` gives a summary of how much time was spent in each method,
but nothing lower level than that. It is similar to Java profiling tools.

The `line_profiler` tool is designed to profile Python code line-by-line, which gives a much more useful
breakdown of where the code spent all of its time. It is also helpful because this can be compared one-to-one
with the results from Perl, and we can get an equal basis for comparing the two languages.

## Python vs Perl: Walltime vs. Operation Count

As with the prior post, I verified that both codes were testing the same number of solutions.
Here is that table of the number of solutions for each value of N, together with the nubmer of solutions tested:

```
--------------------------------------
| NQueens | Nsolutions | Ntested     |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| 8       | 92         | 1965        |
| 9       | 352        | 8042        |
| 10      | 724        | 34815       |
| 11      | 2680       | 164246      |
| 12      | 14200      | 841989      |
| 13      | 73712      | 4601178     |
| 14      | 365596     | 26992957    |
| 15      | 2279184    | 168849888   |
