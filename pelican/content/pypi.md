## Adding Project to Pypi

template repo

checklist of things to think about

- tests
- documentation
- versioning
- changelog

more concretely:

- git branching model should reflect versioning on pypi
- can only upload to pypi once, so think about how to deal with scenarios: bug fixes, typos, etc.

other related services:

- travis ci for testing
- readthedocs or github pages for hosting documentation
- dockerhub for pushing docker container to dockerhub

links:

- semantic versioning
- keep a changelog
