A list of various ongoing projects:

* pandocs and panflute - [how do i pandoc](http://pages.charlesreid1.com/how-do-i-pandoc)
* [captain hook](https://pages.charlesreid1.com/b-captain-hook)

The Git College of Surgery:

* [git college of surgery](https://github.com/git-college-of-surgery)
* The first successful git-commit-ectomy took place on Friday, June 1, 2018.
    See [https://pages.charlesreid1.com/git-commit-ectomy](https://pages.charlesreid1.com/git-commit-ectomy)
* Finishing this requires a better way to visualize git commits
* To do that, we have developed [git-subway-maps](https://pages.charlesreid1.com/git-subway-maps)

Python + APIs:

* building an API that calls APIs so you can API while you API
    (a webhook that calls a hook - see [captain hook](https://pages.charlesreid1.com/b-captain-hook))
* testing APIs with Python + requests (currently top secret,
    coming soon.)

Python + Command line:

* command line utilities with python
* testing command line utilities with python

More stuff:

* [magic flying camel](https://github.com/charlesreid1/magic-flying-camel)
    is a seed repository for getting started with a simple
    Jekyll page on Github Pages

* [magic flying pelican](https://github.com/charlesreid1/magic-flying-pelican)
    is a seed repository for getting started with a simple
    Pelican blog on Github Pages

The rise of the mind machines:

* [boring-mind-machine](https://github.com/rainbow-mind-machine/boring-mind-machine) - contains base classes
    used by all the mind machines
* [rainbow-mind-machine](https://github.com/rainbow-mind-machine/rainbow-mind-machine) - for running Twitter bot flocks
* [embarcadero-mind-machine](https://github.com/rainbow-mind-machine/embarcadero-mind-machine) - for running Github bot flocks
* [cheeseburger-mind-machine](https://github.com/rainbow-mind-machine/cheeseburger-mind-machine) - for running Google Drive bot flocks
* [The rainbow mind machine organization](https://github.com/rainbow-mind-machine) - for containing all of this craziness

Each software package in the mind machine suite
follows (or will follow) the prime number version
system:

* More info on the [Prime Number Version System](https://charlesreid1.com/wiki/Prime_Number_Version_System)
* This is another bit of documentation that was being blocked by 
    the ability to visualize git repositories
* [git-subway-maps](https://pages.charlesreid1.com/git-subway-maps) should
    help with this.

PyPi and Dockerhub:

* Rainbow mind machine software packages are requiring a more
    streamlined deployment process
* Makefiles are in progress

[how do i pandoc](https://pages.charlesreid1.com/how-do-i-pandoc/)

* Currently working on implementing several Pandoc/Panflute filters
* Also see [https://github.com/charlesreid1/translate-yer-docs](https://github.com/charlesreid1/translate-yer-docs)
    for a practical usage of pandoc filters: translating documentation

[how do i pelican](https://pages.charlesreid1.com/how-do-i-pelican) - a crash
course in building a pelican blog

[mkdocs search
demo](https://pages.charlesreid1.com/search-demo-mkdocs-material/) a quick
pop-up site demonstrating how to use the built-in search functionality of 
mkdocs-material and lunr.js to index a pile of markdown files containing
interesting links.

[captain hook](https://pages.charlesreid1.com/b-captain-hook/) - we have already
mentioned captain hook several times, but this is the magic that makes
pages.charlesreid1.com possible.
