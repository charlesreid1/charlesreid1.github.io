----

application to our simple little project:

basic script

structure/layout

jinja environment

load templates from filesystem

jinja syntax double brackets

use to genrate as needed

-----

implications for a more general tool:

command line tool

drop in a customized templated file

- command line tool to drop in a custom config file
- or a custom config directory
- create a file or website layout without the hassle/repetition


what does it look like?

- tool helps you, walks you through process, step by step...
- if you run the command or an action without arguments, it prints help
- if you don't know what to do, you should be able to read/get help

the ideal:

- use this to help parameterize away the generation of snakemake workflows

the problem:

- snakemake already does {{this}}.
