## static vs dynamic

Start with: what is a static site?

Dynamic - something like Python, responsive, custom, processed by server

Static - no changing components on the server's end, just shovel the files over

Can still be dynamic, but using JS, on the client side

## deploying static sites

self-hosted server: nginx

github-hosted: github pages

heroku-hosted: nginx

AWS s3 hosted bucket: see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html

flask, in a pinch
