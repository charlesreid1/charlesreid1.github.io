Lately, I've been diving into colors - colors for plots, colors for maps,
and the effect of color on perception.

I started with [Seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial/color_palettes.html)
and its page on color palettes. 

While I was figuring out colors in Seaborn, I discovered the 
[XKCD color list](http://xkcd.com/color/rgb/), which gave 
all kinds of sensible names to all kinds of colors,
kind of like a 900+-crayon box, except with HTML hex codes.
Cool!

The author of XKCD also wrote up a hilarious summary of the 
results (caution: may make half the population ashamed of their gender)
[here](http://blog.xkcd.com/2010/05/03/color-survey-results/).

Seaborn also led me to more color-related stuff, including a 
[technical report from Sandia](http://www.sandia.gov/~kmorel/documents/ColorMaps/ColorMapsExpanded.pdf)
on color maps and the ineffectiveness of the ubiquitous
rainbow/jet colormap.

Finally, Seaborn also linked to this fantastic, long, and fascinating
six-part [blog post on the subtleties of color](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/elegantfigures/2013/08/05/subtleties-of-color-part-1-of-6/).

Enjoy!
