## Two Examples

In this blog post we'll walk through two examples
of a Josephus problem. Example 1 is $n = 8, m = 4$,
and example two is $n = 11, m = 2$.

We'll show how the process plays out and show
how the solution is expressed using both 
permutation notation and cycle notation.

## n = 8, m = 4

We begin with the example that Knuth gives in his
problem statement, $n = 8, m = 4$.

Here is the Josephus circle for this case:
