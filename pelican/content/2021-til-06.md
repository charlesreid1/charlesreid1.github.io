This year we've been keeping track of some of the surprising things that we have learned.

We call these "Today I Learned", or TILs. We have a private Slack channel set up to keep track
of these, and occasionally we scrape the channel and collect the new TILs into a list.

Once you have a list, it makes it easy to review the things you've learned, and share it with
other people!

Here are the "Today I Learned", or TILs, from June 2021.
