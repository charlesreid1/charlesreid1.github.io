# What is your favorite PEP?

PEPs, or **Python Enhancement Proposals**, are documents in which
features, additions, or general ideas are proposed as additions
to the core Python language.

As a Python user, we believe it's important to ask questions like this.

Picking a "favorite PEP" is not just about having a ready and clever
answer to a question you might expect in a technical interview;
the PEP documents really _are_ important, and really _do_ shape 
where Python is today and where it will be in the future.

So let's look at a few of our favorite PEPs.

## PEP 0: The PEP Index

This is the easiest answer to the question, "what's your favorite PEP?"

[PEP 0 - Index of Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/)
lists all PEPs, including PEPs about PEPs, accepted PEPs, open PEPs,
finished PEPs, informational PEPs, and abandoned PEPs.

This is also a good place to search for a keyword or browse PEPs.
