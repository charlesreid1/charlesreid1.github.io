Last post covered how to write a mock api server but not how to use it

this post covers how to use the mock api server for testing

practicing good principles, like making the api url configurable

simple example using os environment variables, but can do something more fancy later

like use a TestsConfig singleton class or etc

mock api response is just the basics - echoing back request

a more realistic example (simple github api example?) to come
