Am currently working my way through Foucault's _Security, Territory,
and Population_, a collection of transcribed thoughts from the early
1970s and lecture notes from a series of lectures Foucault gave
at the Collége de France in the late 1970s (1977-1978).

Also see [Security, Territory, Population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security,_Territory,_Population)
on Wikipedia.

Here's a quote from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy talking about
an aspect of Foucault's study of institutions of authority:

> The results of exams are recorded in documents that provide detailed
> information about the individuals examined and allow power systems to control
> them (e.g., absentee records for schools, patients’ charts in hospitals). On
> the basis of these records, those in control can formulate categories,
> averages, and norms that are in turn a basis for knowledge. The examination
> turns the individual into a “case”—in both senses of the term: a scientific
> example and an object of care. Caring is always also an opportunity for
> control.

>   Foucault](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/foucault/#HistPris))
