This month, I started keeping track of some of the surprising things
that I learn. I'm using a Slack channel to collect them in one place,
which gives me a nice colelction of personal TILs that I can review
occasionally - and share with other people!

* June 29, 2021: TIL Superfund sites name a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) who is held responsible (through legal and administrative actions) for cleaning up the site.

* June 29, 2021: TIL about the Philby Tape. In a secret videotape from 1981, discovered by the BBC in the Stasi

  his role in sabotaging various operations, and why he believes that his sabotage of Operation Valuable/Fiend
