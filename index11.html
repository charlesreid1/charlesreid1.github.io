<h1>AWSome Day Notes: Part 1: The Basics</h1>
<p>Following are some notes from Amazon's AWSome Day (Tuesday, February 27, 2018).</p>
<h2>EC2 Costs and Scheduling</h2>
<p>Cost of a node:
<em> Important to understand Amazon's price model: users pay for </em>access<em>, not for </em>hardware<em>
</em> Cost of AWS node is cost for <em>on the spot access</em></p>
<p>Scheduling:
<em> If you can anticipate your usage, you can schedule instances in advance, and get a discount
</em> Discount of 50% for one-year reservation (if you keep it busy for 6 months, you've made your money back)
<em> Spot instances also available - need to be robust to sudden starts/stops (good for embarrassingly parallel jobs)
</em> Cheaper to anticipate your usage and plan ahead</p>
<h2>EC2 Transfer Costs</h2>
<p>EC2 Instances:
<em> See <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/">EC2 Instance Pricing - Data Transfer</a> section
</em> Network costs for AWS nodes are an important consideration for high-traffic nodes (&gt;10 TB)</p>
<p>EC2-Internet:
<em> Traffic going from the internet </em>into<em> a node is always free
</em> Traffic going from the node <em>out</em> to the internet incurrs costs after 10 TB
* Outbound traffic costs ~$90/TB</p>
<p>AWS Regions:
<em> Traffic </em>within<em> a region does not incur costs (well... it's complicated)
</em> Traffic <em>between</em> regions will incur costs</p>
<p>EC2-S3:
<em> Transfer </em>into<em> an EC2 node from S3 bucket in same AWS region does not incur costs
</em> Transfer <em>out of</em> an EC2 node into S3 bucket in same AWS region does not incur costs
* (If they did charge you, they would be double-dipping...)</p>
<p>Note: the list of prices is like a legal document, so use the <a href="https://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html">AWS Monthly Calculator</a> to estimate monthly costs with more detail.</p>
<h2>S3 Transfer Costs</h2>
<ul>
<li>See <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/">S3 Pricing - Data Transfer</a></li>
<li>Price model for storage is simliar to price model for AWS nodes: you pay for <em>access</em>, not for <em>hardware</em></li>
<li>To give a sense of why, think about logistics of a large "disk farm": all the intensive operations are done by the head nodes, disks are just passive</li>
<li>Busier disk farm needs sophisticated hardware for parallel read/write, high-bandwidth network lines, fast encryption</li>
</ul>
<p>S3 storage pricing:
* Rule of thumb: ~$20/TB to store the data</p>
<p>S3-Internet:
<em> Transfer </em>into<em> an S3 bucket from the internet is always free (getting stuff into the bucket is the easy part - that's how they get ya)
</em> Transfer <em>out</em> of an S3 bucket to the internet costs ~$90/TB</p>
<p>S3-EC2:
<em> Transfer </em>out<em> of an S3 bucket to most other Amazon regions costs ~$20/TB
</em> Transfer <em>out</em> of an S3 bucket into an EC2 node in the same AWS region does not incur costs
<em> Transfer </em>into* an S3 bucket from an EC2 node in the same AWS region does not incur costs</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this means you won't be double-charged for transferring data from an S3 bucket to an EC2 node, then from the EC2 node out to the internet.</p>
<h2>S3 Storage Hierarchies</h2>
<p>Continuing with the theme of planning ahead...</p>
<p>Storage hierarchies:
<em> Biggest cost of storage is not disk space, it's transfer
</em> Paying for speed, paying for timeliness, paying for <em>on the spot access</em> to your data
* Your data will be cheaper if you're willing to wait a few minutes or deal with a slow connection</p>
<p>Storage hierarchies:
<em> Standard (~<span class="math">\(20/TB)
* Infrequent access (~\)</span>13/TB) - less frequent access, but at same transfer speed
</em> Glacier (~$4/TB) - delay of up to 12 hours (smaller files = faster), deleting data <em>newer</em> than 3 months incurrs costs</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/pricing/">Glacier Pricing</a></p>
<p>Lifecycle rules:
* Can create rules to move old data from S3 buckets into Glacier</p>
<h2>EFS vs EBS vs S3</h2>
<p>When do you use EFS, EBS, or S3?</p>
<p>Elastic Block Storage (EBS):
<em> <strong>This is probably what you want</strong>
</em> EBS is block storage for one EC2 node - designed for general purpose applications
* Cost: ~$120/TB/mo</p>
<p>Elastic File System (EFS):
<em> EFS is block storage for multiple EC2 nodes - designed for fast read-write operations, many incremental changes to files
</em> "Elastic" part of EFS - can dynamically grow as hard drive grows (PB+ scale)
<em> Hard drive on steroids - like plugging in a hard drive over a network, but big/fast/smart enough to be accessible to thousands+ of machines
</em> Expensive: ~$300/TB/mo</p>
<p>S3:
<em> S3 is object storage - it stores blobs of raw data, creates snapshots in time
</em> If you change a single character of a large file, bucket has to create new shapshot
<em> Booting from S3 as a hard disk would take you about a thousand years... don't do that
</em> Cheapest: ~$20/TB</p>
<p>Cool but <span class="math">\($\)</span>:
<em> You may see "appliances" mentioned in Amazon documentation - Amazon will ship you a physical data transfer appliance that encrypts and copies data on site (<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/snowball/latest/ug/images/Snowball-closed-600w.png">Snowball</a>)
</em> Can also purchase special network connections that bypass the public internet - like ISP putting alligator clips between your network lines and Amazon's network lines</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>In this post we'll cover how to set up a web-hosted git server that uses Gitea,
a Github clone that is written in Go. 
While this post is not, strictly speaking, research, 
having your own hosted git server certainly makes it easier to
manage research codes and set up organizations to own different bits of code.</p>
<p>Here's an image of a git repository in the finished product:</p>
<p><img alt="Image of finished product" src="/images/gitea1.png"></p>
<p>We will start by covering the server configuration for Gitea, 
and then we'll cover how to use Gitea's git repository.</p>
<p><a name="gitea-running"></a></p>
<h2>Running with Gitea</h2>
<p>Gitea is a web app for running a self-hosted Github clone. 
It is implemented entirely in the Go language,
so all of the pages that are served up are assembled by the Go binary.
The Go binary also has a local instance of git running, 
and any actions taken through the Gitea web interface
are translated, by the Go binary, into actions in the git reopsitory.</p>
<p>Out of the box, Gitea provides all of this functionality, and takes care of all the details,
so you don't have to worry about any of this. But if you build it yourself,
you can modify the content the binary serves up and the actions it takes. </p>
<p>In this guide, we'll stick to the binary.</p>
<p><img alt="DIagram of how the gitea binary runs as an http server on port 3000." src="/images/gitea-diagram.png"></p>
<p><a name="gitea-bin"></a></p>
<h3>Binary or Source</h3>
<p>There are some problems with the source code that may make compilation from source impossible.
(See <a href="https://charlesreid1.com/wiki/Gitea#Using_Binary">charlesreid1.com wiki notes</a>.)
The binary version of Gitea is recommended. </p>
<p><a name="gitea-config-dir"></a></p>
<h3>Configuring Gitea Directories</h3>
<p>Gitea expects a certain directory organization, specifically, a folder for binaries, 
certificates, a database, git repositories, and the log.</p>
<p>The recommended arrangment is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>/path/to/www/gitea/
   \
    \---------- bin/
     \--------- certs/
      \-------- data/
       \------- repositories/
        \------ log/
</pre></div>


<p>Once the files are organized in this way, navigate to the bin directory
and (preferrably using tmux or screen to send to background) 
execute the command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>./gitea web
</pre></div>


<p>This runs a setup page on port 3000.</p>
<p>Note that you may or may not need to set your <code>$GOPATH</code> variable:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>export GOPATH=&quot;<span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">HOME</span><span class="cp">}</span>/gocode&quot;
</pre></div>


<p>Go ahead and follow the instructions on the page to get Gitea set up.
The <a href="https://gitea.io">gitea.io</a> page has good documentation.</p>
<p><a name="gitea-fw"></a></p>
<h3>Opening the Firewall</h3>
<p>Assuming your port 3000 was closed on the firewall,
and assuming you plan to run the gitea service as a public service listening on an external port, 
you will want to open your firewall to accept incoming traffic on port 3000:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># allow traffic on port 3000
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3000 -j ACCEPT
#  to allow forwarding for 3000 to internal LAN 
iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -j ACCEPT --dport 3000 -m state --state NEW
</pre></div>


<p><a name="gitea-config-server"></a></p>
<h3>Setting Up and Configuring Gitea Server</h3>
<p>To configure gitea, you will use a <code>.ini</code> configuration file contained in:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>/path/to/www/gitea/custom/conf/app.ini
</pre></div>


<p>Here is an example gitea configuration file. It starts with a header, then has sections
for different aspects like databases, the git repository, and the server:</p>

<p>Ultimately, there are many configuration examples available for Gitea,
so we won't go into any more detail on that.</p>
<p>For details on how to configure Gitea with HTTPS, see <a href="https://charlesreid1.com/wiki/Gitea">charlesreid1.com/wiki/Gitea</a>.</p>
<p>Let's move on to how we actually utilize Gitea,
and focus especially on how to make gitea work in tandem with github
and other git servers, instead of being yet another complication in the toolchain.</p>
<p><a name="gitea-use"></a></p>
<h2>How To Use Gitea</h2>
<p>As we mentioned before, the gitea binary is actually wrapping a git repo, 
and interactions with the binary (via the web) are translated into actions in that repo.
This is important to understand, since it will prevent us from thinking about 
gitea as a "centralized" server, and get us thinking about gitea as just another 
computer with a copy of the repository on it.</p>
<p>Understanding how to use gitea also requires correct thinking about how 
distributed version control works - the way that each collaborator 
with a copy of the repo can also act as a decentralized git server. 
In this way, the gitea server becomes just another git client,
with some extra frosting on top in the form of a web interface.</p>
<p><a name="gitea-pushing-local"></a></p>
<h3>Pushing a Local Repo Into Gitea</h3>
<p>If you want to move existing local repositories into gitea, it's easy.
Remember that with git, everything is local, so all you need to do 
is push a copy to gitea, and gitea will have the whole repository locally too,
including its entire history and any branches and tags that were on your local machine.
If you have remotes, you'll need to get local copies of any branches or tags you want
from that remote server (covered in more detail below).</p>
<p>The basic steps:
<em> Get everything you want locally (including branches and tags)
</em> Fetch from remotes, if you have any.
<em> Add new remote (gitea)
</em> Push to new remote</p>
<p>The end result will be a gitea repo fully-populated with the project's commit history.</p>
<p>Here are the steps in a bit more detail:</p>
<p>Start by creating a git repository, or cloning an existing one:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mkdir my_git_repo/
cd my_git_repo
git init .
</pre></div>


<p>or</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git clone http://github.com/mot_pesli/coune_car
</pre></div>


<p>Next, create an empty git repo on the gitea server.
Sign in using a gitea username and password. 
There will be a plus sign in the upper right,
just like on Github. Click the plus sign, and choose create new repo.
Enter the repo name, and a description.
Make sure the repo will NOT automatically create
a readme or a LICENSE file, as we will be importing all files
from another repo anyway.</p>
<p>Once you've got a local copy of the repo with everything you want to push,
and you have an empty repository on the gitea server ready for commits,
add the gitea repository as a new remote to your local repository.</p>
<p>Example: suppose you have a gitea user named <code>zappa</code> who has created a new empty repo 
named <code>linol-aquabus</code> on the gitea server. 
Zappa would then cd to the local copy of the git repo,
and add the gitea repository's url as a new remote called <code>gitea</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git remote add gitea https://git.mydomain.com/zappa/linol-aquabus.git

# alternatively,

git remote add gitea https://mydomain.com:3000/zappa/linol-aquabus.git
</pre></div>


<p>Now Zappa can push the entire commit history of the current repo
to the gitea remote git server:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git push origin gitea

# alternatively,

git push --all origin gitea
</pre></div>


<p>If Zappa now visits <code>mydomain.com:3000/zappa/linol-aquabus</code> the entire
contents of the repository and its commit history in gitea's web interface
will be available for browsing.</p>
<p><a name="gitea-copying"></a></p>
<h3>Copying Repos from Gitub to Gitea</h3>
<p>The process for copying Github repositories to Gitea follows the above procedure closely:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
</pre></div>


<p>Check out any branches or tags you may want to push to gitea.</p>
<p>Then add the gitea remote to the repo:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git remote add gitea https://git.mydomain.com/zappa/linol-aquabus.git
</pre></div>


<p>Now push the contents of the local repository to the remote gitea repository:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git push origin gitea
</pre></div>


<p>Once this command is executed, the gitea remote will have the entire commit history of the repo,
which it will render and display through its web interface. Thus, the entire commit history
will be immediately available to browse through gitea.</p>
<p>(Note that information about Github issues or Github user profiles is not stored in the git repo,
just as Gitea comments and Gitea user profiles are not stored in the git repo.)</p>
<p><img alt="Gitea and Github - same repo, side by side." src="/images/gitea-n-github.png"></p>
<p><a name="gitea-moving"></a></p>
<h3>"Moving" Repos from Gitub to Gitea</h3>
<p>First, it should be stated up front that you do not have to choose 
between gitea and github - you can have a copy of a repo on both,
frequently push to one or the other, and occasionally update the other
as a kind of "mirror."</p>
<p>If you do want to <em>move</em> a repo from github to gitea,
remember that github does not "own" the repo,
so what you're actually doing is deleting the copy of your repo 
that lives on github's server.</p>
<p>To move the repo, all you have to do is copy it from github to somewhere else
(whether it be your local computer, or to the gitea server), then delete it from github.
You will not lose any information about the git repository history.
Github does not keep/store that information - git does.</p>
<p><a name="gitea-pushing-commits"></a></p>
<h3>Where to Push Commits: Github or Gitea?</h3>
<p>It may seem confusing to use multiple repositories side-by-side,
but this is precisely how the designers of git intended it to be used - 
for decentralized version control.</p>
<p>That means Github or Gitea are not "centralized" servers that "own" the repository,
they are merely another instance of git, running on a server, with a local copy of the repo.</p>
<p>Accordingly, if your project exists as a repo on gitea and as a repo on github, 
it is like the project existing as a repo on your hard drive and as a repo on your collaborator's hard drive -
there is no contradiction. If you make changes to your local copy of the repo, you can commit those changes,
then push the commits to someone else. In the same way, you can make changes to your local copy of the repo 
and commit those changes, then push the commits to either gitea, or github, or both - wherever you want.</p>
<p><a name="gitea-backing-up"></a></p>
<h3>Backing Up Gitea</h3>
<p>It's important to say a few words about backups.</p>
<p>Because Gitea is configured (with the above config file) to use sqlite,
it stores its entire database (the extra "frosting" of stars, wiki pages,
issues, user pictures, etc.) in a single file on disk, in the <code>data/</code> directory
of the gitea installation.</p>
<p>The git repository is, similarly, a single file on disk, with the entire database 
of commits, blogs, commit histories, etc., all contained in the <code>.git</code> directory,
which is contained in the <code>repositories</code> directory of the gitea installation.</p>
<p>That means backing up your git server is as easy as copying the gitea folder.
No need to back up a MySQL database or do a funny pants dance to export your database
to a proprietary format. </p>
<p>This is another central tenent of git's design philosophy - 
be fast, pack light, and travel easily.</p>
<p><a name="gitea-patterns"></a></p>
<h2>How Gitea Fits Into Git Patterns</h2>
<p>There are <a href="https://charlesreid1.com/wiki/Git_Resources">many resources on git</a>,
and some cover the concept of "git patterns," 
or templates for how to use git.</p>
<p>Because git is designed to be decentralized, 
gitea provides a "centralized" node for collaboration
within a decentralized system.
So you could use gitea to collaborate with 
your local Team A, and push and pull branches 
and work on various features together.
Then, once Team A has put together a branch they've found useful,
they can push it to a different remote server that is more widely accessed.</p>
<p>(Note that this is the logic behind why you need to 
check out all the branches and tags, <em>locally</em>, that you want to push 
to the gitea remote server - this allows you the flexibility to 
only share select branches, so that you might have 
some branches shared in common wth gitea and github,
and other branches only existing on gitea.)</p>
<p>Team B and Team C may use github, and not gitea, to access the project code.
The gitea server may for example be a private server on a local network,
whereas github is better suited for collaboration.
By pushing select branches from the Team A git server, gitea,
to the github server, Team B and Team C will then be able to 
access them from github.</p>
<p>You could also have multiple gitea/gitlab/github enterprise servers 
for multiple organizations running on git, and they could share a code base 
by sharing git repositories, commit histories, branches, and so on.</p>
<p><a name="gitea-wrapup"></a></p>
<h2>Wrapup</h2>
<p>Have a look at the <a href="http://gitea.io">Gitea project</a>, <a href="https://golang.org">the Go language</a>,
<a href="https://git-scm.com">git</a>, <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> for all the nice software
that made this possible. </p>
<p>Then have a look at the finished product at <a href="https://git.charlesreid1.com">git.charlesreid1.com</a>.</p>
<p>Gitea allows you to create organizations, useful for organizing repos related to 
particular functionality or platforms. For example, <a href="https://git.charlesreid1.com/rpi">rpi</a> 
is an organization that owns repositories with scripts and software for raspberry pis,
<a href="https://git.charlesreid1.com/docker">docker</a> is an organization that owns repositories
with Dockerfiles, and <a href="https://git.charlesreid1.com/mac">mac</a> holds Mac-related things.</p>
<p>This organization allows better organization of project code - a dotfiles repository
that works for a Mac laptop or a Unix server is not necessarily good for a Raspberry Pi
or a Docker container, so code is organized accordingly.</p>
<p>Organizations can also be used to organize project-level code. 
This git repo is in its beginning phases, but has great potential
as a great tool that makes git even more functional and provides 
one more reason to switch to git.</p></div>

<h2>Before We Begin: The Code</h2>
<p>Note that all of the code discussed/shown in this post is available from the 
traveling salesperson problem repository on <a href="https://git.charlesreid1.com/charlesreid1/tsp">git.charlesreid1.com</a>.
The <code>guava/</code> directory contains the guava solution to the traveling salesperson problem,
along with the timing scripts discussed below, and several example output files.</p>
<p><a name="better-timing-intro"></a></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Timing a piece of code can be tricky. </p>
<p>Choosing a random problem of a given size can be problematic,
if you happen to randomly chose a particularly easy or difficult case.
This can lead to an inaccurate picture of scale-up behavior.
Timing results should be statistically averaged - the figure below
shows scale-up behavior for the traveling salesperson problem
when solving a single random problem, versus a hundred random problems.</p>
<p><img alt="Average versus one-time solutions, walltime versus problem size." src="/images/avg-vs-onetime-walltime.png"></p>
<p>This post will cover some conceptual and code tools 
for measuring the timing and performance of code.</p>
<p><a name="better-timing-timing"></a></p>
<h2>Timing Scripts</h2>
<p>Timing a piece of code is a task that sounds simple, on its face.
However, the task of profiling code quickly balloons 
from a single timing of a single bit of code 
to running hundreds of cases, juggling output from each run,
and stitching together script upon script.
Soon you find yourself swimming in a pool of output files,
looking for your scripts...</p>
<p>In this post we'll cover a workflow for timing a piece of Java code
that will help give you a method for thinking about timing.
This also balances the need for practicality
(i.e., just get it done in as simple a manner as possible)
with good design 
(i.e., flexible inputs and the use of scripts).</p>
<h2>Before You Time: Developing Your Algorithm</h2>
<p>As you develop your algorithm, you may have variable values hard-coded 
and random number generators seeding from the same value each time.
The intention, as you are developing, is to work out the bugs
without the additional difficulty of solving a different problem
each time you run the program.</p>
<h2>Beginning Your Timing Journey</h2>
<p>Once you've implemented your algorithm and verified that it works,
the timing portion begins. You can time the code using mechanisms
built into the language, which is the most accurate way of 
timing code. This is called <em>instrumenting</em> your code.
To begin with, you might try timing a single problem size, 
but this information is hard to interpret without more data,
so you start to time the code on problems of other sizes.</p>
<p>Here there be dragons.</p>
<h2>Statistical Timing, a.k.a., If You Give A Mouse A Cookie</h2>
<p>See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_You_Give_a_Mouse_a_Cookie"><em>If You Give A Mouse A Cookie</em></a>.</p>
<p>Once you time the code solving a single problem,
you will want to time the code solving multiple problems.</p>
<p>Once you time the code solving multiple problems,
you will want to time the code solving each problem multiple times 
to get an accurate statistical picture of the solution time on a variety of problems.</p>
<p>Once you get statistics about multiple problem times,
you will want to gather statics about variations in problem types and algorithm variations.</p>
<p>It simply does not end. A strategy for managing this deluge of new timing needs 
prevents spaghetti code.</p>
<h2>Hierarchical Timing Strategy</h2>
<p>The strategy here is to design code and scripts that are <em>hierarchical</em>.
The levels of the hierarchy consist of the different scopes involved in timing:
<em> Single problem/program/binary
</em> Multiple problem/program/binary
<em> Statistical averages using case matrix
</em> Design of Computer Experiments: Testing Variations 
* Strong and weak scaling (if we decide to continue with parallelization of algorithm)</p>
<p>At each stage, we utilize scripts to bundle the task into a single command or script.</p>
<h2>Single Problem/Program/Binary: Makefile</h2>
<p>At the scale of solving a single problem, we need a tool that will 
compile and run Java code - even if it only happens once.
Makefiles are an excellent tool for stringing together commands with flags 
(in the case of the traveling salesperson problem,
we need to link to the Guava Jars when we compile and run).</p>
<p>By defining some variables at the top of the Makefile, 
and a few rules, we have a functional and easy way to build code 
with scalable complexity:</p>

<p>For running single cases and gathering small amounts of (initial) timing data,
Makefiles greatly simplify the workflow.</p>
<h2>Multiple Program/Problem/Binary: Bash</h2>
<p>Bash is a faithful scripting language that makes it easy to do 
simple mechanical tasks like run commands in for loops,
necessary for the next level of complexity in our timing hierarchy.</p>
<p>While the task at hand is simple enough, and we could easily use Makefiles, 
we'll use a separate Bash script for separate functionality 
and keep things from getting overly complicated in the Makefile.</p>
<p>The essence of the timing script is combining the <code>make time</code> command,
which takes a size parameter, with bash for loops.</p>
<p>Here is a stripped down version of the timing script:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>make build 

for N in 4 5 6 7 8
do
    make time SIZE=<span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="cp">}</span> 
done
</pre></div>


<p>That's it... The rest is just printing!</p>
<p>The <code>make time</code> command passes the size argument on the command line.
The Java Traveling Salesperson Problem code checks if there is an input argument on the command line,
and if there is it uses that as the problem size.</p>
<p>Here's a more embellished script:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>export RIGHTNOW=&quot;`date +&quot;%Y%m%d_%H%M%S&quot;`&quot;
export OUT=&quot;timeout_tsp_java_<span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">RIGHTNOW</span><span class="cp">}</span>.out&quot;
touch <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">OUT</span><span class="cp">}</span>
cat /dev/null &gt; <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">OUT</span><span class="cp">}</span>

# Compile

for N in {4..8..1}
do
    echo &quot;**************************************&quot; &gt;&gt; <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">OUT</span><span class="cp">}</span>
    echo &quot;Running TSP with <span class="nv">$N</span> nodes with Java...&quot; &gt;&gt; <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">OUT</span><span class="cp">}</span>

    make time SIZE=<span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="cp">}</span> &gt;&gt; <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">OUT</span><span class="cp">}</span> 2&gt;<span class="err">&amp;</span>1

<p>In this way we can run a quick test matrix of different problem sizes,
and see how the code scales.</p>
<h2>Statistical Averaging</h2>
<p>Of course, any good computational physicist will tell you that scaling behavior
extrapolated from running a single case of a single problem size is folly - 
your random choice of graph could have been an unusually easy or difficult graph,
throwing off the results of the timing. </p>
<p>A proper scaling study really needs to take into account the statistical trends 
in solution time on a random assortment of problems, 
so we need a way of scripting solutions to dozens or hundreds of random problems 
and computing statistically representative measures of code performance.</p>
<p>Our code implements a function to generate random graphs, 
but for testing and debugging purposes the random number generator 
was seeded with the same value each time. By making the random number generators
truly random, each problem we solve will be a different random graph
with the specified number ofn odes.</p>
<p>We can accomplish all of this using bash again: within the for loop over different problem sizes,
we will add a for loop for repetitions.
Here is the basic framework:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>make build 

for N in {4..10..1}
do
    for repetition in {0..100..1}
    do
        make time SIZE=<span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="cp">}</span> 
    done
done
</pre></div>


<p>And the embellished version that prints the resulting timing information to a file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># Compile
make build 

export RIGHTNOW=&quot;`date +&quot;%Y%m%d_%H%M%S&quot;`&quot;

    touch <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">OUT</span><span class="cp">}</span>

    echo &quot;**************************************&quot; &gt;&gt; <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">OUT</span><span class="cp">}</span>
    echo &quot;Running TSP with <span class="nv">$N</span> nodes with Java...&quot; &gt;&gt; <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">OUT</span><span class="cp">}</span>

<p>Now we have a Makefile that allows us to build and run with a single command,
and a bash script that loops over each problem size and runs a set of computations
for each problem size. But how to compute an average?</p>
<p>We have an assortment of choices - Python being the most obvious - but in the spirit of
old-school Unix tools like make, cat, grep, and wc, let's use <code>awk</code> to compute the average 
walltime for each case size.</p>
<h2>Awk to Compute Average Walltime</h2>
<p>Given the following output of elapsed walltime for different problem sizes,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ cat avgtimeout_tsp_20170330_235134_11.out <span class="p">|</span> grep Elapsed

<p>we want to extract two things: 
the first is the problem size (contained in the filename),
and the second is the column of numbers.</p>
<p>We can extract the problem size from the filename using sed,
by searching for the pattern <code>_8.out</code> or <code>_10.out</code>. 
Here is a Bash one-liner that does this for a variable <code>$f</code> 
containing the filename:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    N=$(echo $f | sed &#39;s/^.*_\([0-9]\{1,\}\).out/\1/&#39;)
</pre></div>


<p>The next thing we wnat to do is extract the column of timing data.
This is a good task for the <code>cut</code> utility. We can pass it two flags,
<code>-d</code> to tell it what to use as a field delimiter, and <code>-f</code> to tell it which field
(column) to return. To extract the third column,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    cat $f | grep &quot;Elapsed&quot; | cut -d&quot; &quot; -f3 
</pre></div>


<p>This command results in a series of floating point numbers. If we can pipe it to a program
that can do simple math, like <code>awk</code>, we can compute an average (which is pretty simple math).</p>
<p>Since <code>awk</code> is a text-proecssing program that happens to be able to interpret numbers as numbers,
we have to think like a text processing program. To compute an average, we accumulate the sum
of each line in the file, using an accumulator variable. When we have gone through each line in the file,
we divide this cumulative sum by the number of lines in the file.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    cat $f | grep &quot;Elapsed&quot; | cut -d&quot; &quot; -f3 | awk &#39;{a+=$1} END{print a/NR}&#39;
</pre></div>


<p>This one-liner uses two important concepts in <code>awk</code>, the first is the bracketed blocks <code>{}</code> 
some denoted with <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code>, and the second is the set of built-in variables available in <code>awk</code>.</p>
<p>By surrounding statements by brackets, we denote a block of statements to be run together as the main body of the program.
If the bracket is prefixed by <code>BEFORE</code>, this block of statements is run once at the beginning of the program.
If the bracket is prefixed by <code>END</code>, this block of statements is run once at the end of the program.
To compute an average, the main body of the program is to accumulate a cumulative sum variable. 
The <code>END</code> block, run once at the end, is to divide this cumulative sum by the total number of lines.</p>
<p>Finally, these values can be assigned to Bash variables using <code>$(cmd)</code> syntax:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    export N=$(echo <span class="nv">$f</span> | sed &#39;s/^.*_\([0-9]\{1,\}\).out/\1/&#39;)
    export AVG=$(cat <span class="nv">$f</span> | grep &quot;Elapsed&quot; | cut -d&quot; &quot; -f3 | awk &#39;{a+=$1} END{print a/NR}&#39;) 
    echo &quot;Average time : <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="cp">}</span>-node TSP problem : <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">AVG</span><span class="cp">}</span> s&quot;
</pre></div>


<p>Here is the final script, which loops over all of the output files
generated by the statistical average timing script,
which runs 10-100 cases per problem size:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="ch">#!/bin/sh</span>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The figure below shows the results of the timing study when using the average of 100 different random problems, 
compared to the timing study performed using a single problem size.</p>
<p><img alt="Average versus one-time solutions, walltime versus problem size." src="/images/avg-vs-onetime-walltime.png"></p>
<p>The results show dramatically different behavior, highlighting the importance
of computing the statistical average of solution walltime for many different problems.
This was not an issue that arose in discussing timing or profiling of codes to solve the 
8 queens problem, because in that case the problem (and resulting decision tree)
were determined by the choice of algorithm.</p>
<p>This information is also important ot keep in mind when comparing the timing performance 
of two algorithms - using many cases to compare two algorithms is preferrable,
since it reduces the likelihood of randomly selecting a problem that highights 
a weakness of one algorithm or a strength of the other.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this post we covered some scripting tools that make timing a lot easier to do,
and some ways of thinking about and building up scripts 
to allow for more complex timing studies without an increase 
in the associated post-processing work involved.</p>
<p>We showed how to use <code>make</code> and a Makefile to create compact, expressive commands to build and run Java programs.
We showed how to use Bash scripting to implement loops and run a case matrix of problems of various sizes,
measuring timing data for hundreds of problems in total.
All of these scripts made heavy use of Unix command line tools, 
demonstrating how to chain commands and functionality together on the command line to accomplish complex tasks.
Finally, we showed how to use the <code>awk</code> programming language to compute the average of a set of numbers,
exploring yet another application of this unusually handy language.</p></div>
