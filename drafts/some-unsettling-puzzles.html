<p>Recently I ran across two rather unsettling puzzles that were
worded so poorly, and were so distasteful in their presentation,
that I wanted to call them out as needing to be cast aside
and replaced with better and more palatable versions - 
which are <em>readily available</em> in the form of <em>existing problems</em>.</p>
<h1>The First Unsettling Puzzle</h1>
<h2>Tired: The Evil King</h2>
<p>This question comes to us from Goodrich et al, "Data Structures and Algorithms in Python":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An evil king has <span class="math">\(n\)</span> bottles of wine, and a spy has just
poisoned one of them. Unforutnately, they do not know which
one it is. The poison is very deadly; just one drop diluted
even a billion to one wil still kill. Even so, it takes
a full month for the poison to take effect. Design a scheme
for determining exactly which one of the wine bottles was 
poisoned in just one month's time while expending <span class="math">\(O(\log n)\)</span>
taste testers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can we all agree, that if the premise of an end-of-the-chapter
exercise involves actively helping an evil king save <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span> 
bottles of wine by murdering <span class="math">\(n\)</span> innocent people, that textbook
<em>may have an ethics issue</em>?</p>
<p>Actively teaching students to abstract away distasteful actions into
mathematical problems is a terrible idea. You wouldn't introduce students
to machine learning algorithms by having them write software for
a drone with a machine gun to recognize and target humans. That would
be a stupid skill to teach. </p>
<p>Why, just imagine, for a moment, if you can, how dire the situation would
be, if tech companies were filled with brilliant problem 
solvers who were also very good at abstracting away worrisome 
details about the personal data they were operating on, the privacy
they were violating, or the end uses of their systems.</p>
<h3>Solving the Real Problem</h3>
<p>Let's all agree that the real problem here is the king, so the optimal
way of solving this problem is to expend exactly <span class="math">\(1\)</span> taste tester
(the king) by having him drink one glass of wine formed from a drop
of all <span class="math">\(n\)</span> bottles.</p>
<p>The less optimal and rather greusome solution involves creating a binary tree
where each leaf node is a glass of wine, and each parent node combines the two 
wines below it. A slightly less optimal solution than "expending" <span class="math">\(1\)</span> taste 
tester (above) is to carry out this plan, but seat the king at the root of the 
tree, which accomplishes the same thing as the <span class="math">\(O(1)\)</span> deaths solution (above).</p>
<h2>Wired: Find the Counterfeit</h2>
<p>A better verison of this problem usually follows a template like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are given <span class="math">\(n\)</span> coins, of which <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span> coins are gold and <span class="math">\(1\)</span> coin is
counterfeit lead (heavier). You also have a fair scale.  Determine, with only
<span class="math">\(w\)</span> weighings using the scale, which coin is the counterfeit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason this problem is better (besides no deaths) is that <span class="math">\(w\)</span>
is an integer that is smaller than <span class="math">\(\log_{2}{n}\)</span>, which is where you
have to be creative and think beyond the binary tree. (It is in fact
<span class="math">\(\log_{3}{n}\)</span>, since all coins have an identical weight, and therefore
if two groups are weighed against each other, the heavier contains the
counterfeit. If the weights are the same, the counterfeit is in the
third group. </p>
<h1>The Second Unsettling Puzzle</h1>
<h2>Tired: The Josephus Problem</h2>
<p>The second of our twounsettling puzzles has the excuse of being
both 40 years old (it truly was a different time in computer science)
and being rooted in a historically greusome puzzle about mass execution.</p>
<p>Let's jump in!</p>
<p>This problem comes to us from Donald Knuth's <u>The Art of Computer Programming</u>
(TAOCP) Volume 1, which covers some basic (ha ha, not really) mathematics
and introduces some fundamental algorithms and data structures.</p>
<p>In Section 1.3.2 (which introduces the MIX assembly language,
then presents a set of exercises that are essentially recreational
puzzles that are well-suited to being solved with a computer),
Knuth poses the following problem (Exercise 22, rated a "31" on
Knuth's 0-to-50 scale):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(The Josephus Problem.) There are <span class="math">\(n\)</span> men arranged in a circle. Begining at a
particular position, we count around the circle and brutally execute every
<span class="math">\(m^{th}\)</span> man (the circle closing as men are decapitated). For example, the
execution ordr when <span class="math">\(n=8, m=4\)</span> is <span class="math">\(54613872\)</span>: the first man is fifth to go,
the second man is fourth, etc.</p>
<p>Write a complete MIX program which prints out the order of execution when
<span class="math">\(n=24, m=11\)</span>. Try to design a clever algorithm which works at high speed when
<span class="math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(m\)</span> are large (it may save your life).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Solving the Real Problem</h3>
<p>Note that we're not going to go through the solution to this Josephus problem
here - that will come in a later blog post. Plus there are a number of exercises
in TAOCP that build on the solution to the above problem, so we will cover those
as well.</p>
<h2>Wired: Girls Playing Ball</h2>
<p>Boris Kordemsky, a famous Russian puzzle master (think of him as a Russian
equivalent of Martin Gardner), posed the following puzzle, which is included
in <u>The Moscow Puzzles</u> (published by Dover), called "Girls Playing Ball"
(Puzzle 23). </p>
<p>While different from the Josephus problem, it's a more tasteful
version of a related problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Twelve girls</strong> in a circle began to toss a ball, each girl to her neighbor on the left.
When the ball had completed the circle, it was tossed in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>After a while one of the girls said: "Let's skip 1 girl as we toss the ball."</p>
<p>"But since there are 12 of us, half the girls will not be playing," Natasha objected.</p>
<p>"Well, let's skip 2 girls!"</p>
<p>"This would be even worse - only 4 would be playing. We should skip 4 girls -
the fifth would catch it. There is no other combination."</p>
<p>"And if we skip 6?"</p>
<p>"It is the same as skipping 4, only the ball goes in the opposite direction,"
Natasha answered.</p>
<p>"And if we skip 10 girls each time, so that the eleventh girl catches it?"</p>
<p>"But we have already played that way," said Natasha.</p>
<p>They began to draw diagrams of every such way to toss the ball, and were
soon convinced that Nattasha was right. Besides skipping none, only skipping
4 (or its mirror image 6) let all the girls participate.</p>
<p>If there had been 13 girls, the ball could have been tossed skipping 1 girl,
or 2 girls, or 3 girls, or 4 girls, without leaving any girls out. How 
about 5 and 6?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thing I like about this presentation of the problem, besides the fact that it
is free of death and decapitation, is that it explains the problem, giving 
multiple examples in the form of the conversation that takes place. This
gives the reader a jump start in their thinking about the problem.</p>
<p>This problem is different from (simpler than?) the Josephus problem, 
and deals with small values of <span class="math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, but I like the spirit 
of the question and its presentation, and it could be easily adapted.</p>
<h2>Wired: Sushi Boats</h2>
<p>An alternative presentation of the problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are the only customer at a sushi restaurant
with <span class="math">\(n\)</span> small boats carrying trays of sushi
going past you.</p>
<p>To occupy yourself while you eat, you devise
the following scheme: beginning with a particular
boat, you consume the sushi on that boat.
You then count <span class="math">\(m\)</span> boats carrying sushi,
eating the sushi that the <span class="math">\(m^{th}\)</span> boat is
carrying. (Empty boats don't count.)J</p>
<p>For example, if there are <span class="math">\(n = 8\)</span> sushi boats and
you eat from every <span class="math">\(4^{th}\)</span> boat with sushi,
the order in which each boat is consumed is
given by <span class="math">\(54613872\)</span>: the first sushi boat
is consumed first, the second sushi boat
is consumed fourth, and so on.</p>
<p>Write a program to print out the order in which
sushi boats are consumed for <span class="math">\(n = 24\)</span> and <span class="math">\(m = 11\)</span>.
Try to design a clever algorithm to work at
high speed when <span class="math">\(n, m\)</span> are large (and use it to
figure out which boat will be eaten last).</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Puzzling Conclusions</h1>
<p>When writing puzzles or exercises, don't resort to the appeal of violence
and murder to get readers interested in your problem. The mathematics is
the point. Problems should age well, so leave out the politics,
sexism, racism, and any other isms. And above all - stop teaching people 
to suspend their ethics as the first step in problem-solving.</p>
