<h2>Before We Begin: The Code</h2>
<p>Note that all of the code discussed/shown in this post is available from the 
traveling salesperson problem repository on <a href="https://charlesreid1.com:3000/charlesreid1/tsp">git.charlesreid1.com</a>.
The <code>guava/</code> directory contains the guava solution to the traveling salesperson problem,
along with the timing scripts discussed below, and several example output files.</p>
<p><a name="better-timing-intro"></a></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Timing a piece of code can be tricky. </p>
<p>Choosing a random problem of a given size can be problematic,
if you happen to randomly chose a particularly easy or difficult case.
This can lead to an inaccurate picture of scale-up behavior.
Timing results should be statistically averaged - the figure below
shows scale-up behavior for the traveling salesperson problem
when solving a single random problem, versus a hundred random problems.</p>
<p><img alt="Average versus one-time solutions, walltime versus problem size." src="/images/avg-vs-onetime-walltime.png"></p>
<p>This post will cover some conceptual and code tools 
for measuring the timing and performance of code.</p>
<p><a name="better-timing-timing"></a></p>
<h2>Timing Scripts</h2>
<p>Timing a piece of code is a task that sounds simple, on its face.
However, the task of profiling code quickly balloons 
from a single timing of a single bit of code 
to running hundreds of cases, juggling output from each run,
and stitching together script upon script.
Soon you find yourself swimming in a pool of output files,
looking for your scripts...</p>
<p>In this post we'll cover a workflow for timing a piece of Java code
that will help give you a method for thinking about timing.
This also balances the need for practicality
(i.e., just get it done in as simple a manner as possible)
with good design 
(i.e., flexible inputs and the use of scripts).</p>
<h2>Before You Time: Developing Your Algorithm</h2>
<p>As you develop your algorithm, you may have variable values hard-coded 
and random number generators seeding from the same value each time.
The intention, as you are developing, is to work out the bugs
without the additional difficulty of solving a different problem
each time you run the program.</p>
<h2>Beginning Your Timing Journey</h2>
<p>Once you've implemented your algorithm and verified that it works,
the timing portion begins. You can time the code using mechanisms
built into the language, which is the most accurate way of 
timing code. This is called <em>instrumenting</em> your code.
To begin with, you might try timing a single problem size, 
but this information is hard to interpret without more data,
so you start to time the code on problems of other sizes.</p>
<p>Here there be dragons.</p>
<h2>Statistical Timing, a.k.a., If You Give A Mouse A Cookie</h2>
<p>See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_You_Give_a_Mouse_a_Cookie"><em>If You Give A Mouse A Cookie</em></a>.</p>
<p>Once you time the code solving a single problem,
you will want to time the code solving multiple problems.</p>
<p>Once you time the code solving multiple problems,
you will want to time the code solving each problem multiple times 
to get an accurate statistical picture of the solution time on a variety of problems.</p>
<p>Once you get statistics about multiple problem times,
you will want to gather statics about variations in problem types and algorithm variations.</p>
<p>It simply does not end. A strategy for managing this deluge of new timing needs 
prevents spaghetti code.</p>
<h2>Hierarchical Timing Strategy</h2>
<p>The strategy here is to design code and scripts that are <em>hierarchical</em>.
The levels of the hierarchy consist of the different scopes involved in timing:
<em> Single problem/program/binary
</em> Multiple problem/program/binary
<em> Statistical averages using case matrix
</em> Design of Computer Experiments: Testing Variations 
* Strong and weak scaling (if we decide to continue with parallelization of algorithm)</p>
<p>At each stage, we utilize scripts to bundle the task into a single command or script.</p>
<h2>Single Problem/Program/Binary: Makefile</h2>
<p>At the scale of solving a single problem, we need a tool that will 
compile and run Java code - even if it only happens once.
Makefiles are an excellent tool for stringing together commands with flags 
(in the case of the traveling salesperson problem,
we need to link to the Guava Jars when we compile and run).</p>
<p>By defining some variables at the top of the Makefile, 
and a few rules, we have a functional and easy way to build code 
with scalable complexity:</p>

<p>For running single cases and gathering small amounts of (initial) timing data,
Makefiles greatly simplify the workflow.</p>
<h2>Multiple Program/Problem/Binary: Bash</h2>
<p>Bash is a faithful scripting language that makes it easy to do 
simple mechanical tasks like run commands in for loops,
necessary for the next level of complexity in our timing hierarchy.</p>
<p>While the task at hand is simple enough, and we could easily use Makefiles, 
we'll use a separate Bash script for separate functionality 
and keep things from getting overly complicated in the Makefile.</p>
<p>The essence of the timing script is combining the <code>make time</code> command,
which takes a size parameter, with bash for loops.</p>
<p>Here is a stripped down version of the timing script:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>make build 

for N in 4 5 6 7 8
do
    make time SIZE=<span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="cp">}</span> 
done
</pre></div>


<p>That's it... The rest is just printing!</p>
<p>The <code>make time</code> command passes the size argument on the command line.
The Java Traveling Salesperson Problem code checks if there is an input argument on the command line,
and if there is it uses that as the problem size.</p>
<p>Here's a more embellished script:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>export RIGHTNOW=&quot;`date +&quot;%Y%m%d_%H%M%S&quot;`&quot;
export OUT=&quot;timeout_tsp_java_<span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">RIGHTNOW</span><span class="cp">}</span>.out&quot;
touch <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">OUT</span><span class="cp">}</span>
cat /dev/null &gt; <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">OUT</span><span class="cp">}</span>

# Compile
make build 

for N in {4..8..1}
do
    echo &quot;**************************************&quot; &gt;&gt; <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">OUT</span><span class="cp">}</span>
    echo &quot;Running TSP with <span class="nv">$N</span> nodes with Java...&quot; &gt;&gt; <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">OUT</span><span class="cp">}</span>

    make time SIZE=<span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="cp">}</span> &gt;&gt; <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">OUT</span><span class="cp">}</span> 2&gt;<span class="err">&amp;</span>1

    make dot
    mv graphviz.png graphviz_tsp_<span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="cp">}</span>.png

    echo &quot;Done.&quot; &gt;&gt; <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">OUT</span><span class="cp">}</span>

    echo &quot;&quot; &gt;&gt; <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">OUT</span><span class="cp">}</span>

done

echo &quot;&quot;
echo <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">OUTFILE</span><span class="cp">}</span>

<p>This creates a time-and-date-stamped output file in which 
all of the output of this script goes - and which can be 
parsed for plotting the results of timing studies.</p>
<p>Before it times the solution to the TSP, it dumps out a graphviz dot file 
containing a schematic of the graph that can be diagrammed:</p>

<p>In this way we can run a quick test matrix of different problem sizes,
and see how the code scales.</p>
<h2>Statistical Averaging</h2>
<p>Of course, any good computational physicist will tell you that scaling behavior
extrapolated from running a single case of a single problem size is folly - 
your random choice of graph could have been an unusually easy or difficult graph,
throwing off the results of the timing. </p>
<p>A proper scaling study really needs to take into account the statistical trends 
in solution time on a random assortment of problems, 
so we need a way of scripting solutions to dozens or hundreds of random problems 
and computing statistically representative measures of code performance.</p>
<p>Our code implements a function to generate random graphs, 
but for testing and debugging purposes the random number generator 
was seeded with the same value each time. By making the random number generators
truly random, each problem we solve will be a different random graph
with the specified number ofn odes.</p>
<p>We can accomplish all of this using bash again: within the for loop over different problem sizes,
we will add a for loop for repetitions.
Here is the basic framework:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>make build 

for N in {4..10..1}
do
    for repetition in {0..100..1}
    do
        make time SIZE=<span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="cp">}</span> 
    done
done
</pre></div>


<p>And the embellished version that prints the resulting timing information to a file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># Compile
make build 

export RIGHTNOW=&quot;`date +&quot;%Y%m%d_%H%M%S&quot;`&quot;

<p>Now we have a Makefile that allows us to build and run with a single command,
and a bash script that loops over each problem size and runs a set of computations
for each problem size. But how to compute an average?</p>
<p>We have an assortment of choices - Python being the most obvious - but in the spirit of
old-school Unix tools like make, cat, grep, and wc, let's use <code>awk</code> to compute the average 
walltime for each case size.</p>
<h2>Awk to Compute Average Walltime</h2>
<p>Given the following output of elapsed walltime for different problem sizes,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ cat avgtimeout_tsp_20170330_235134_11.out <span class="p">|</span> grep Elapsed

<p>we want to extract two things: 
the first is the problem size (contained in the filename),
and the second is the column of numbers.</p>
<p>We can extract the problem size from the filename using sed,
by searching for the pattern <code>_8.out</code> or <code>_10.out</code>. 
Here is a Bash one-liner that does this for a variable <code>$f</code> 
containing the filename:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    N=$(echo $f | sed &#39;s/^.*_\([0-9]\{1,\}\).out/\1/&#39;)
</pre></div>


<p>The next thing we wnat to do is extract the column of timing data.
This is a good task for the <code>cut</code> utility. We can pass it two flags,
<code>-d</code> to tell it what to use as a field delimiter, and <code>-f</code> to tell it which field
(column) to return. To extract the third column,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    cat $f | grep &quot;Elapsed&quot; | cut -d&quot; &quot; -f3 
</pre></div>


<p>This command results in a series of floating point numbers. If we can pipe it to a program
that can do simple math, like <code>awk</code>, we can compute an average (which is pretty simple math).</p>
<p>Since <code>awk</code> is a text-proecssing program that happens to be able to interpret numbers as numbers,
we have to think like a text processing program. To compute an average, we accumulate the sum
of each line in the file, using an accumulator variable. When we have gone through each line in the file,
we divide this cumulative sum by the number of lines in the file.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    cat $f | grep &quot;Elapsed&quot; | cut -d&quot; &quot; -f3 | awk &#39;{a+=$1} END{print a/NR}&#39;
</pre></div>


<p>This one-liner uses two important concepts in <code>awk</code>, the first is the bracketed blocks <code>{}</code> 
some denoted with <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code>, and the second is the set of built-in variables available in <code>awk</code>.</p>
<p>By surrounding statements by brackets, we denote a block of statements to be run together as the main body of the program.
If the bracket is prefixed by <code>BEFORE</code>, this block of statements is run once at the beginning of the program.
If the bracket is prefixed by <code>END</code>, this block of statements is run once at the end of the program.
To compute an average, the main body of the program is to accumulate a cumulative sum variable. 
The <code>END</code> block, run once at the end, is to divide this cumulative sum by the total number of lines.</p>
<p>Finally, these values can be assigned to Bash variables using <code>$(cmd)</code> syntax:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    export N=$(echo <span class="nv">$f</span> | sed &#39;s/^.*_\([0-9]\{1,\}\).out/\1/&#39;)
    export AVG=$(cat <span class="nv">$f</span> | grep &quot;Elapsed&quot; | cut -d&quot; &quot; -f3 | awk &#39;{a+=$1} END{print a/NR}&#39;) 
    echo &quot;Average time : <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="cp">}</span>-node TSP problem : <span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">AVG</span><span class="cp">}</span> s&quot;
</pre></div>


<p>Here is the final script, which loops over all of the output files
generated by the statistical average timing script,
which runs 10-100 cases per problem size:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="ch">#!/bin/sh</span>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The figure below shows the results of the timing study when using the average of 100 different random problems, 
compared to the timing study performed using a single problem size.</p>
<p><img alt="Average versus one-time solutions, walltime versus problem size." src="/images/avg-vs-onetime-walltime.png"></p>
<p>The results show dramatically different behavior, highlighting the importance
of computing the statistical average of solution walltime for many different problems.
This was not an issue that arose in discussing timing or profiling of codes to solve the 
8 queens problem, because in that case the problem (and resulting decision tree)
were determined by the choice of algorithm.</p>
<p>This information is also important ot keep in mind when comparing the timing performance 
of two algorithms - using many cases to compare two algorithms is preferrable,
since it reduces the likelihood of randomly selecting a problem that highights 
a weakness of one algorithm or a strength of the other.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this post we covered some scripting tools that make timing a lot easier to do,
and some ways of thinking about and building up scripts 
to allow for more complex timing studies without an increase 
in the associated post-processing work involved.</p>
<p>We showed how to use <code>make</code> and a Makefile to create compact, expressive commands to build and run Java programs.
We showed how to use Bash scripting to implement loops and run a case matrix of problems of various sizes,
measuring timing data for hundreds of problems in total.
All of these scripts made heavy use of Unix command line tools, 
demonstrating how to chain commands and functionality together on the command line to accomplish complex tasks.
Finally, we showed how to use the <code>awk</code> programming language to compute the average of a set of numbers,
exploring yet another application of this unusually handy language.</p></div>
