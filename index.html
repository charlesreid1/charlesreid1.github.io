<h1>Summary</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If a feature branch or pull request gets too complicated and should be refactored
  into simpler pieces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new feature branch from the original destination branch</li>
<li>Turn commits into patches, or cherry-pick commits (leaving changes unstaged)</li>
<li>Apply patches or cherry-picks to the feature branch</li>
<li>Use <code>git add --patch</code> or <code>git add --edit</code> to selectively split out changes into separate commits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a commit gets too large, you can rebase your branch, and mark that particular commit
  to be edited (<code>git rebase HASH_OF_COMMIT~1</code>). </p>
<ul>
<li>The rebase will replay that commit, and stage the changes, but will not 
  commit them, allowing you to edit the commit.</li>
<li>Use <code>git add --patch</code> or <code>git add --edit</code> to selectively split out changes</li>
<li>Remember you can also perform the same procedure on the resulting commits,
  further splitting each commit into sub-commits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This post contains many common patterns applied to different workflows.</p>
<h1>Managing Complexity</h1>
<p>When collaborating on software, especially large software with people who are not the
primary developers, it is important to limit the complexity of features and proposed
changes. Why is it bad practice to propose large, complex changes?</p>
<ul>
<li>It is harder to review the proposed changes</li>
<li>Bugs increase in likelihood, and increase in likelihood far faster than the amount of code.</li>
<li>More complex changes usually combine </li>
</ul>
<h1>Refactoring Large Branches</h1>
<p>Consider the case of a large feature branch that is suffering from feature creep (trying to
cram too many changes into one branch.) For example, in the process of implementing a feature,
you may also implement significant fixups, refactoring of functions, and code cleanup that is
in the same file but not entirely related. While writing tests for the new feature, you may also
refactor tests to be cleaner, or to use context manager foobar, or etc.</p>
<p>To illustrate: suppose you are on a branch called <code>feature</code> (created off of <code>master</code>) that consists of
three sets of changes, DEF:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>A - B - C (master)
    \
     D1 - E1 - D2 - F1 - E2 - F2 - D3 - F3 - E3 (feature)
</pre></div>


<ul>
<li>D corresponds to implementing the new feature and writing tests for it</li>
<li>E corresponds to fixups to the same file that was changed to implement the feature</li>
<li>F corresponds to fixups to tests unrelated to the new feature</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, in reality, if things were really so clean, if you had a time machine or the patience to
to rebase commits one at a time and split them into atomic changes only to the features in their
scope (which would be super easy because of course your git logs are filled with helpful, concise
commit messages) you could use <code>git cherry-pick</code> to replay commits D1, D2, D3 onto a new D
branch, and so on. </p>
<p>But in reality, commit F1 contains a little bit of E1, and D2, and vice versa, and so on.
It's much easier to navigate a diff and select pieces from it.  That's were <code>git add -e</code>
(or <code>--edit</code>) will help.</p>
<p>We also have to turn a set of commits into a single set of unstaged changes (meaning, replay
the changes each commit made but not replay the commits themselves). There are a few ways
to do this, we'll cover two ways: squashing and rolling back a set of commits, and converting
a set of commits into a set of patch files.</p>
<p>Once the commits have been rolled back and unstaged, particular changes can be staged for each
split commit using <code>git add -e</code> and using the editor to select which changes to include or exclude
from the commit. As each commit is created, branches can be created that are linked to the group
of changes in each new commit.</p>
<h2>Converting Set of Commits to Unstaged Changes</h2>
<p>We are trying to untangle a set of unrelated changes into separate commits that group related
changes together. For the example, we want to convert this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>A - B - C (master)
    \
     D1 - E1 - D2 - F1 - E2 - F2 - D3 - F3 - E3 (feature)
</pre></div>


<p>to this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>A - B - C (master)
    \
     D - E - F (feature)
</pre></div>


<p>so that the changes in commits D, E, and F are simpler, more limited in scope, and easier to review.</p>
<h3>git format-patch</h3>
<p>To create a set of patches, one per commit, to edit them or apply them in various orders,
you can use <code>git format-patch</code> with a commit range:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git format-patch D1..E3
</pre></div>


<p>This will create a series of patches like </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>patches/0001-the-D1-commit-message.patch
patches/0001-the-E1-commit-message.patch
patches/0001-the-D2-commit-message.patch
patches/0001-the-F1-commit-message.patch
patches/0001-the-E2-commit-message.patch
patches/0001-the-F2-commit-message.patch
patches/0001-the-D3-commit-message.patch
patches/0001-the-F3-commit-message.patch
patches/0001-the-E3-commit-message.patch
</pre></div>


<p>Patches can be further split or modified, and can be applied in the desired order (although
changes in line numbers happening out of order may confuse the program applying the patch).</p>
<p>Start by creating a branch from the desired commit (commit <code>B</code> in the diagram above):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git checkout B
</pre></div>


<p>(where <code>B</code> should be either the commit hash for commit B, or a tag or branch that is associated
with commit B). Now create a branch that will start from that commit (we'll start with our branch
for feature D here):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git checkout -b feature-d
</pre></div>


<p>Now apply patches to the new branch, which will start from commit <code>B</code>.</p>
<p>To apply a patch, use <code>patch -p1</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>patch -p1 &lt; 0001-the-D1-commit-message.patch
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>-p1</code> strips the prefix by 1 directory level, which is necessary with patches created
by git. We use <code>patch</code> rather than <code>git am</code> to apply the patch, because we want to apply
the changes independent of git, and only stage the changes we want into our next commit.</p>
<p>If you have a series of commits that you want to squash, that's also easy to do by applying
each patch for those commits, then staging all the changes from those patches into a new
commit.</p>
<p>As patches are applied, particular changes can be staged and commits can be crafted. Use 
the <code>--edit</code> or <code>--patch</code> flags of <code>git add</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git add --edit &lt;filename&gt;
git add --patch &lt;filename&gt;
</pre></div>


<p>This allows selective filtering of particular edits into the next commit, so that one patch
(or any number of patches) can be applied, and selective changes can be staged into a commit.</p>
<p>Once you are ready, just run</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git commit
</pre></div>


<p>without specifying the filename. (If you specify the filename, it will stage all changes,
and ignore the crafting you've done.)</p>
<p>As you create a commit or a set of commits specific to changeset D, you can work on a D branch.
When you finish all commits related to D, you can start a new branch with</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git checkout feature-e
</pre></div>


<p>that will start a new branch from where the d-branch left off. Chaining your
changes together into several small branches that build on each other will 
help keep pull requests simpler too.</p>
<p>The advantages of this approach include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commits can be split by applying the patch and staging particular edits</li>
<li>The ability to split single commits into more commits, or combine/squash commits together, means
  this approach has a lot of flexibility</li>
<li>Best for some situations where, e.g., a long series of commits with many small commits that should
  be squashed and some large commits that should be split </li>
</ul>
<p>The disadvantages of this approach include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patches applied out of order can confuse the program applying the patches</li>
</ul>
<h3>cherry-pick and unstage</h3>
<p>An alternative to the above workflow is to use <code>git cherry-pick</code> to apply the changes from particular
commits, but to leave those changes unstaged using the <code>--no-commit</code> or <code>-n</code> flag:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git cherry-pick --no-commit &lt;commit-hash&gt;
git cherry-pick -n &lt;commit-hash&gt;
</pre></div>


<p>Alternatively, a range of commits can be used instead:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git cherry-pick -n &lt;commit-hash-start&gt;..&lt;commit-hash-end&gt;
</pre></div>


<p>This can help achieve a similar level of flexibility to the patch approach.</p>
<h3>soft reset and commit</h3>
<p>Suppose the commit history is simple enough that you can squash all of the commits together
into a single diff set, and pick the changes to split into commits D, E, and F.</p>
<p>In that case, the easiest way might be to roll back all of the commits made, but preserve
the changes that each commit made. This is precisely what a <em>soft reset</em> will do.</p>
<p>For the git commit history</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>A - B - C (master)
    \
     D1 - E1 - D2 - F1 - E2 - F2 - D3 - F3 - E3 (feature)
</pre></div>


<p>Run the command</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git reset --soft B
</pre></div>


<p>to move the HEAD pointer to commit B, while also <em>preserving</em> all changes made from the
start of the feature branch <code>D1</code> to the tip of the feature branch <code>E3</code>, all added as
staged changes (as though they had been <code>git add</code>-ed).</p>
<p>The changes will be staged, but changes to files can be unstaged using</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git restore --staged &lt;filename&gt;
</pre></div>


<p>Now add changes selectively using the <code>--edit</code> or <code>--patch</code> flags</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git add --edit &lt;filename&gt;
git add --patch &lt;filename&gt;
</pre></div>


<p>If desired, those changes can be unstaged, and then re-staged using <code>git add --edit</code> or
<code>git add --patch</code> to selectively add changes to particular commits.</p>
<p>When done, run </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git commit
</pre></div>


<p>with no arguments to commit the changes you made.</p>
<h1>Refactoring Large Pull Requests</h1>
<p>The approaches above can be useful for refactoring branches. The end result will look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>A - B - C (master)
    \
     D (feature-d)
      \ 
       E (feature-e)
        \
         F (feature-f)
</pre></div>


<p>Now 3 pull requests can be made, one for each feature. Thanks to the refactoring above, each branch
should be a more isolated set of changes that are all related, and therefore easier to review.</p>
<h2>Chaining Pull Requests</h2>
<p>The three D E F branches should be merged in together, since they are all related. But their changes should
be kept separate to make reviewing each branch easier. To accomplish this, chain the pull requests together
like so:</p>
<p>Pull Request 1: merge <code>feature-d</code> into <code>master</code></p>
<p>Pull Request 2: merge <code>feature-e</code> into <code>feature-d</code></p>
<p>Pull Request 3: merge <code>feature-f</code> into <code>feature-e</code></p>
<p>In this way, each pull request only shows the changes specific to that branch.</p>
<p>(If each pull request were made against <code>master</code>, then later branches (F) would also incorporate changes
from prior branches (D), resulting in messy and hard-to-review pull requests.)</p>
<p>Pull requests are reviewed and discussed, and new commits will probably be added to fix things or incorporate
feedback:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>A - B - C (master)
    \
     D - DA - DB (feature-d)
      \ 
       E - EA - EB (feature-e)
        \
         F - FA - FB (feature-f)
</pre></div>


<h2>Preparing to Merge a Large Pull Request</h2>
<p>All of your pull requests are approved and ready to merge. Now what?</p>
<p>Pull requests will need to be merged in reverse order (last PR is merged first - f into e, e into d, d into
master).  To test that things go smoothly with the first pull request (<code>feature-f</code> into <code>feature-e</code>), we should
create a local E-F integration branch.</p>
<p>The local integration branch will have new commits if changes are needed to resolve merge conflicts or fix
broken tests. Any changes made can be added to the <code>feature-f</code> branch and pushed to the remote, so that
they are part of the pull request, making the merge into <code>feature-e</code> go smoothly.</p>
<p>To create a throwaway E-F integration branch, we start by creating a test integration branch from the tip of the
<code>feature-f</code> branch, and we will merge branch <code>feature-e</code> into branch <code>feature-f</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git checkout feature-f
</pre></div>


<p>Now we create a local E-F integration branch:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git checkout -b integration-e-f
</pre></div>


<p>Now we merge <code>feature-e</code> into <code>integration-e-f</code>, which is the same as <code>feature-f</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git merge --no-ff feature-e
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>--no-ff</code> flag creates a separate merge commit, which is useful here to keep our commit history clean.</p>
<p>If merge conflicts are encountered, those can be resolved in the usual manner, and the (conflict-free) new
versions of each file, reflecting changes from <code>feature-f</code> and <code>feature-e</code>, will all be present after the
merge commit.</p>
<p>Further commits can also be made to make tests pass, with a resulting git diagram:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>A - B - C (master)
    \
     D - DA - DB (feature-d)
      \ 
       E - EA - EB ----
        \              \
         F - FA - FB - EF1 - EF2 (integration-e-f)
                              ^
                             HEAD
</pre></div>


<p>Once the <code>integration-e-f</code> branch is polished and passing tests, we can re-label it as <code>feature-f</code> and push
the new commits to the remote. To re-label <code>integration-e-f</code> as <code>feature-f</code>, assuming we're at the tip of
the <code>integration-e-f</code> branch (where we left off above):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git branch -D feature-f
git checkout -b feature-f
</pre></div>


<p>and push the new commits to the remote's <code>feature-f</code> branch, before you merge in the pull request (<code>feature-f</code>
into <code>feature-e</code>):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git push origin feature-f
</pre></div>


<p>Now you are ready to merge pull request 3 (F into E).</p>
<h2>Rinse and Repeat</h2>
<p>Rinse and repeat for pull requests 2 and 1.</p>
<p>For Pull Request 2, we start by creating a new <code>integration-d-e-f</code> branch from the tip of the
<code>integration-e-f</code> branch, like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git checkout integration-d-e
git checkout -b integration-d-e-f
</pre></div>


<p>and use the same approach of merging in the <code>feature-d</code> branch with an explicit merge commit:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git merge --no-ff feature-d
</pre></div>


<p>Work out any merge conflicts that result, and add any additional changes needed to get tests passing,
and you should now have a git commit history like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>A - B - C (master)
    \
     D - DA - DB ----------------
      \                          \
       E - EA - EB ----           \
        \              \           \
         F - FA - FB - EF1 - EF2 - DEF1 - DEF2 (integration-d-e-f)
                                            ^
                                           HEAD
</pre></div>


<p>Now re-label the <code>integration-d-e-f</code> branch as <code>feature-e</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git branch -D feature-e &amp;&amp; git checkout -b feature-e
</pre></div>


<p>Finally, push all new commits to the remote, including the new merge
commit, which will make sure the pull request can be merged without
any conflicts:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git push origin feature-e
</pre></div>


<p>Now PR 2 (E into D) can be merged.</p>
<h2>Final Merge into Master</h2>
<p>The last and final PR, D into master, will merge all combined feature
branches into the master branch. We start with a <code>feature-d</code> branch
that has several commits related to feature D, then several commits
from merging the <code>feature-e</code> branch in (pull request 2, E into D),
and the <code>feature-e</code> branch also had <code>feature-f</code> merged into it.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>A - B - C (master)
     \
      D - D2 - DEF1 - DEF2 (feature-d)
</pre></div>


<p>Now we will create one more commit on the <code>feature-d</code> branch that is
merging <code>master</code> into <code>feature-d</code>, which will help the merge happen
smoothly for pull request 1 (D into master).</p>
<p>But first we switch to an integration branch, in case things don't go
smoothly and we want to throw away the merge commit:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git branch integration-def-master
</pre></div>


<p>Create an explicit merge commit to merge <code>master</code> into <code>integration-def-master</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git merge --no-ff master
</pre></div>


<p>Work out any merge conflicts that result, and add any additional changes needed to get tests passing,
and you should now have a git commit history like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>A - B - C (master)
     \   \---------------------
      \                        \
       D - D2 - DEF1 - DEF2 - DEF3 (integration-def-master)
</pre></div>


<p>where commit <code>DEF3</code> is the merge commit created with the <code>--no-ff</code> command.</p>
<p>The merge commit will resolve any conflicts. When you're satisfied with the
merge commit, you can switch out the <code>integration-def-master</code> branch with the
<code>feature-d</code> branch like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git branch -D feature-d
git checkout -b feature-d
</pre></div>


<p>Now you can push the merge commit to the remote:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git push origin feature-d
</pre></div>


<p>and you're now ready to merge your (conflict-free) pull request!</p></div>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make your commits small and atomic, and recombine them into
  larger commits later; it's easier to combine smaller commits
  than to split large commits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make use of <code>git add -p</code> and <code>git add -e</code> to stage
  changes selectively and atomically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make use of <code>git rebase</code> and <code>git cherry-pick</code> to edit your
  commits and assemble them in the order you want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once commits have been combine and the history is satisfactory,
  push to a remote to share the work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think about ordering your commits to "tell a story". (What that
  means will depend on the people you are collaborating with!)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>What is a commit</h1>
<p>Before we get into the good stuff, let's talk about the
anatomy of a git commit.</p>
<p>When you add files to your git repository, it's a two-step
process: <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code>. The first step <em>stages</em>
your changes, the second step memorializes those staged changes
into a commit that can now be shared with others by pushing it
to git remotes.</p>
<h2>git add</h2>
<p>It is important to know that git does not keep track of changes at
the file level, it keeps track of changes at the character/line level.</p>
<p>What that means is, when you modify a line in a file that is in your
git repository, and run <code>git add</code> to stage your change, git has created
an object under the hood called a <em>blob</em> to represent that one line change.</p>
<p>If you change two lines in two different parts of a file, and stage those
changes using <code>git add</code>, git will treat this as two separate changes, and
represent the changes with two different blobs.</p>
<h2>git commit</h2>
<p>As you use <code>git add</code> to prepare your changes, the changes are added to
a <em>staging area</em>. Think of this staging area as a draft commit. Each change
being added to the staging area changes how the commit will look. When the
changes are complete and the user runs <code>git commit</code>, it turns the staging
area into a real commit, creates the metadata, and calculates hashes.</p>
<p>When a commit is created, it receives a name, which is the hash of the
contents of the commit. The hash is computed from the contents of the
blobs, plus the metadata about the commit, plus the hash of the prior
commits. Changing a commit changes its hash, and will change the hashes
of all subsequent commits.</p>
<p>Commits in your local repository can be easily rewritten and edited, and
their hashes changed. A common workflow is to make many small commits,
and recombine them later.</p>
<p>Because the commit hash is how the commit is named, modifying commits
after you've shared them is bad practice and will create extra work for
your collaborators. For that reason, don't <code>git push</code> until you're ready
to share your work.</p>
<h2>git rebase</h2>
<p>The <code>git rebase</code> command allows you to edit your commit history. We will
cover some usage patterns in the sections below.</p>
<h2>git fetch and git pull</h2>
<p>Before pushing changes to the remote, first check if there have been any
commits since you began your branch.</p>
<h3>rebase, merge, branch, pass</h3>
<p>If a feature branch is created off of the master branch, and some time passes,
the feature branch base commit may grow far out of sync with the master branch.
(Note that <code>master</code> indicates the primary branch.)</p>
<p>This leaves the developer of the feature branch a few choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>rebase</strong> - continue to rebase all commits on the feature branch from the
  original feature branch base commit onto the head commit of the master branch.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: clean history, easy for one-branch-one-developer workflow</li>
<li>Cons: requires continual force-pushes, requires coordination between developers
  to prevent squashing others' work, not scalable, some people hate this method</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>merge</strong> - occasionally merge work from the master branch into the feature branch.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: simple to understand, simple to carry out, low cognitive load</li>
<li>Cons: clutters PR review by mixing feature changes with merged changes, clutters the
  commit history</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>branch</strong> - by making heavy use of throwaway branches and integration branches,
  it is easier to test out how the integration of a feature branch based on an old
  commit on <code>master</code> will do when merging it in with a newer version of <code>master</code>.
  Use throwaway integration branches to test out merging the two branches together,
  testing its functionality, etc. You can also rebase or cherry pick commits onto
  the throwaway integration branch, and figure out how to arrange the commits on a
  branch to "rebuild" it into a working, mergeable branch.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: easy to do, encourages local use of throwaway branches</li>
<li>Cons: clutters branches, integration process has to be repeated (can be mitigated
  with <code>git rerere</code>), merge commits must wait until PR is approved</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>pass</strong> - best combined with the branch approach mentioned above, the pass approach
  is to leave the branch history clean, avoid force-pushes, and rely on throwaway
  branches to test out merge strategies once the inevitable PR merge needs to happen.
  It can also be useful to wait for code reviews to finish, then create a merge commit
  to make the merge happen smoothly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: easy to do</li>
<li>Cons: merge commits must wait until PR is approved</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>git push</h2>
<p>Once you run <code>git push</code>, all of the commits on the branch that you pushed
will end up on the remote, where others can access them. The purpose
of a <code>git push</code> is to share commits, so generally you don't push branches
until they are ready to share. This also allows more flexibility in crafting,
rewriting, and combining commits.</p>
<h2>force pushing</h2>
<p>If you pushed a branch (which is a collection of commits) to a remote,
and then you have edited those commits, you will run into a problem when
you try and <code>git push</code> the new, edited versions of the commits to the same
remote. The remote will detect that there are conflicting versions of
the branch and will reject the changes.</p>
<p>That's where <code>git push --force</code> comes in. The <code>--force</code> flag tells the
remote to discard its version of the branch and use the version of the
branch that you are pushing.</p>
<p>We will cover more about force pushing - when to do it, when not to, and
why some people hate it - in part 3 of this post. For now, we will only say
that you should not force push often, since you can risk deleting others' work
and creating additional confusion and work for all of your collaborators.</p>
<h1>Commit Workflow</h1>
<h2>Principles</h2>
<p>Here are some principles for your <code>git commit</code> workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Commit small changes often.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't sweat the commit messages - they can be fixed up later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Related - nobody will see your commits until you push your branch,
  so think of your branch as a scratch space. You have the ultimate
  freedom to use it however you want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Branches are easy to create, so make liberal use of branches!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be wary of force pushing, and of rewriting history.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Making Small Commits</h2>
<p>Two essential git commands to help with making small commits are
git add (patch mode) and git add (interactive mode).</p>
<h3>git add patch mode</h3>
<p>How to use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">git</span> <span class="k">add</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="k">of</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">file</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>git add -p</code> command allows the user to interactively stage
individual changes made (in what is called patch mode). This means
users can stage certain changes for one commit, then stage other
changes for a different commit.</p>
<p>This solves the problem of making a long sequence of changes
to a single file that should be logically separated into
different steps. (For example, changing the <code>import</code> statements
versus changing the name of a variable throughout a file).</p>
<p>For example, suppose we have the following changes to a file named <code>doit.sh</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ <span class="nv">git</span> <span class="nv">diff</span> <span class="nv">doit</span>.<span class="nv">sh</span>

<p>There are two related changes and one unrelated change, respectively.

<p>Now the two related changes are staged, and the unrelated change is not staged.
This is reflected in <code>git status</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ <span class="nv">git</span> <span class="nv">status</span>

<p>Now <code>git commit</code> will commit only the staged portions.</p>
<p>Do not provide any filenames to <code>git commit</code>, so that git will only commit the staged changes.</p>
<p>To use this in your workflow, think about how you can group different changes together into
different commits. If you get a portion of a feature working, you can commit the changes in
groups so that related changes get committed together.</p>
<p>Also remember that if your commit history ends up being excessively long or overly detailed,
you can always examine what changes different commits made with <code>git diff</code>, and reorder them
with <code>git cherry-pick</code> or modify/combine them with <code>git rebase</code>.</p>
<h3>git add editor mode</h3>
<p>How to use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">git</span> <span class="k">add</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">e</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="k">of</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">file</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Like the interactive patch mode, <code>git add -e</code> allows you to selectively
stage certain changes in a file. But it's much better for keyboard jockeys
and those that love their text editor, because you can choose which changes
to stage or not using the text editor.</p>
<p>A sidebar:</p>
<p>If you have not yet set the text editor that git uses, you should
do that now. Modify your git configuration with this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">config</span> <span class="c1">--global core.editor vim</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Alternatively, put the following in your <code>~/.gitconfig</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">[core]</span>
    <span class="na">editor</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">vim</span>
</pre></div>


<p>(Or, you know, whatever your text editor of choice is.)</p>
<p>End of sidebar.</p>
<p>When you pass the <code>-e</code> flag to git add, it will open a new editor window with the full diff:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gh">diff --git a/doit.sh b/doit.sh</span>
<span class="gh">index 326273c..14e4059 100644</span>
<span class="gd">--- a/doit.sh</span>
<span class="gi">+++ b/doit.sh</span>
<span class="gu">@@ -1,17 +1,17 @@</span>
 #!/bin/bash
 #
<span class="gd">-# This script lists the 50 largest files in the git repo history</span>
<span class="gi">+# This script lists the 10 largest files in the git repo history</span>

 $ git rev-list --all --objects | \
      sed -n $(git rev-list --objects --all | \

      \
      while read hash type size; do
           echo -n &quot;-e s/$hash/$size/p &quot;;
      done) | \
<span class="gd">-     sort -nru -k1</span>
<span class="gi">+     sort -nr -k1</span>
</pre></div>


<p><strong>Editing this file requires some care!</strong></p>
<p>Fortunately there is a section in the documentation for
<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add">git add</a> called
<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add#_editing_patches">Editing Patches</a>.</p>
<p>Two things to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lines starting with <code>+</code> indicate new, added content. To prevent this
  content from being added, delete the line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lines starting with <code>-</code> indicate removed content. To keep this content,
  replace <code>-</code> with a space (<code></code>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you are finished, make sure you review the changes that are staged,
particularly if this is the first time seeing patch files or the diff
syntax.</p>
<h2>Modifying Commits</h2>
<p>There is always some reason or another to modify the commit history of a repository -
perhaps someone's work was lost, or the wrong issue or pull request number was referenced,
or a username was misspelled.</p>
<p>You can always modify a commit, but it will also modify every commit that came after it.
Think of it like replaying the changes recorded in each commit onto the new branch. The
contents of each commit changes slightly, so the hash (the name) of every commit changes.</p>
<h3>git rebase</h3>
<p>To do a git rebase, an interactive rebase (the <code>-i</code> flag) is recommended.</p>
<p>The rebase action takes two commits, and will replay the commits.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The first commit given (the start commit) is <em>not</em> included
in the rebase. To include it, add <code>~1</code> to the start commit. (For example,
<code>0a1b2c3d~1</code> refers to the commit before commit <code>0a1b2c3d</code>.</p>
<h4>rebasing a range of commits</h4>
<p>To rebase from the start commit hash to the end commit hash, and include the start commit
in the rebase, the rebase command is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">rebase</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="n">START_COMMIT_HASH</span><span class="o">~</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="n">END_COMMIT_HASH</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This does not indicate a destination branch. The default behavior is for the branch to move
and the new pile of commits to retain the same branch name.</p>
<h4>rebasing onto another branch</h4>
<p>To rebase a range of commits onto a different branch (for example, onto a <code>master</code> branch
that has the latest changes from the remote), use the <code>--onto</code> flag:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">rebase</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="n">START_COMMIT_HASH</span> <span class="n">END_COMMIT_HASH</span> <span class="c1">--onto TARGET_BRANCH</span>
</pre></div>


<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The above rebase commands will leave your repo in a headless state - unlike
the behavior of the prior command, the branch label will not move with you to the new pile
of commits.</p>
<p>Run <code>git checkout -b &lt;branchname&gt;</code> to give your new rebased branch a meaningful name.
This creates a branch wherever HEAD is, which is pointing to the top of the pile of rebased
commits.</p>
<p>If you want the old branch label to move to the new pile of commits, it requires a bit of branch
housekeeping - you have to delete the old branch, then create a new branch from where
HEAD is (the end of the rebase), then check out that branch.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">branch</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">D</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">branchname</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">checkout</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">branchname</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<h2>Rearranging Commits</h2>
<p>Where rebasing allows for editing commits en masse, cherry picking allows the changes made in
individual commits to be applied anywhere - including other branches. This makes the atomic
commit principle from the beginning of this post much easier - groups of related commits that
happened out of order can be rearranged by cherry picking them onto a new branch, and the new
branch is a better "story".</p>
<h2>Combining Commits</h2>
<p>The cherry pick operation can also be combined with a rebase - once multiple small commits are
arranged together chronologically, a git rebase operation enables squashing those tiny commits
into a small number of larger commits, all carrying related changes.</p></div>

<h1>Source</h1>
<p>Most of the good stuff is from
<a href="https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles">https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles</a>!</p>
<h1>user section</h1>
<p>Start off easy - here's how you set your email and name for commits:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">[user]</span>
    <span class="na">email</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">foo@bar.com</span>
<span class="s">    name = Foo Bar</span>
</pre></div>


<h1>Bash Aliases</h1>
<h2>The Best One Letter Alias Ever</h2>
<p>Start supercharging how you use git by creating a one-letter alias.</p>
<p>Add this to your <code>~/.bashrc</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">alias</span> <span class="k">g</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="ss">&quot;git&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You're already saving yourself a bunch of keystrokes, and we're just getting started!</p>
<h2>Ending Bad Habits</h2>
<p>This is a nice trick for getting yourself out of bad habits.
My first time using a "sophisticated" branch worklow in git
(i.e., not just committing and pushing to master all the time),
I got in trouble for committing directly to master with a
<code>git push origin master</code> (instead of making a feature branch
and opening a pull request).</p>
<p>To get myself out of the habit of typing <code>git push origin master</code>,
I wanted to map it to an alias that told me no. I did that by
defining <code>git</code> to be a bash function (this works because functions
take precedence over a binary named <code>git</code> on your path).</p>
<p>The git function checks the arguments that are passed to it.
If the arguments are <code>push origin master</code>, it means I'm typing
<code>git push origin master</code>, and I get a slap on the wrist.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it passes the arguments through to the <code>git</code> binary.</p>
<p>You can also put this in <code>~/.bashrc</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[[</span> <span class="nv">$@</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;push origin master&quot;</span> <span class="o">]]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>
        <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;nope&quot;</span>
    <span class="k">else</span>
        <span class="nb">command</span> git <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$@</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
    <span class="k">fi</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>


<h1>alias section</h1>
<p>In the <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file, aliases specific to git can be
defined in a section beginning with alias.</p>
<h2>Log Utils</h2>
<p>Let's start with some utilities for viewing git logs.</p>
<p>(You can never have too many ways to look at a git log.)</p>
<p>Note that we'll assume the alias bit in the following git config excerpts.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">[alias]</span>
    <span class="c1"># courtesy of https://stackoverflow.com/a/34467298</span>

</pre></div>


<p>The <code>git lgX</code> shortcuts give similar views of the log, but with increasing vertical spacing.
<code>git lg1</code> is the most compact, while <code>git lg3</code> is the most comfortable to read, as far as vertical whitespace.
Same with the <code>-specific</code> commands.</p>
<p>This is one more nice short log command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="o">#</span> <span class="k">View</span> <span class="n">abbreviated</span> <span class="n">SHA</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">description</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">and</span> <span class="n">history</span> <span class="n">graph</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">latest</span> <span class="mi">20</span> <span class="n">commits</span>
    <span class="n">l</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">log</span> <span class="c1">--pretty=oneline -n 20 --graph --abbrev-commit</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Remember to use this with the <code>g</code> alias for super short log:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ g l

<h2>Status Utils</h2>
<p>The git status command is one of my most frequently used commands, so I made a few shortcuts:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="o">#</span> <span class="k">View</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="k">current</span> <span class="n">working</span> <span class="n">tree</span> <span class="n">status</span> <span class="k">using</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">short</span> <span class="n">format</span>
    <span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">status</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">s</span>
    <span class="n">ss</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">status</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This makes checking the short or long status of a git repo easy:</p>

<h2>Fetching</h2>
<p>Fetching is handy to do, since it just fetches changes from a remote and doesn't actually
change anything or try to merge anything (unlike a <code>git pull</code> command).</p>
<p>The most useful fetch command (<code>git fetch --all</code>) is aliased to <code>g f</code> with the following
bit in the aliases section of the <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">fetch</span> <span class="c1">--all</span>
</pre></div>


<h2>Branch Utils</h2>
<p>The only command I might use more than the status command are branch commands,
so here are several branch aliases:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">branch</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">v</span>
    <span class="n">bv</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">branch</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">v</span>
    <span class="n">bb</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">branch</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">v</span>

    <span class="n">ba</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">branch</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">a</span>
    <span class="n">bb</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">branch</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">v</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">a</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In a similar way, you can get a summary view using <code>g b</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ g b
  master 4c828cd <span class="o">[</span>behind <span class="m">84</span><span class="o">]</span> update with awsome day notes
* <span class="nb">source</span> b18adfd add two git workflow posts

$ g b
  master 940ee98 update mocking post
* <span class="nb">source</span> b18adfd add two git workflow posts
</pre></div>


<p>and a little bit more information with <code>g bb</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ g bb
  master            940ee98 update mocking post
* <span class="nb">source</span>            b18adfd add two git workflow posts
  remotes/gh/HEAD   -&gt; gh/source
  remotes/gh/master 940ee98 update mocking post
  remotes/gh/source b18adfd add two git workflow posts
</pre></div>


<h3>Branch and Checkout</h3>
<p>Sometimes if you are creaing a branch with a long branch name, it can be
inconvenient to have to first create the branch with <code>git branch &lt;branch-name&gt;</code>
and then check it out with <code>git checkout &lt;branch-name&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>To resolve this you can define a <code>git go</code> alias that creates the branch and
then switches to that branch:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    # <span class="nv">Switch</span> <span class="nv">to</span> <span class="nv">a</span> <span class="nv">branch</span>, <span class="nv">creating</span> <span class="nv">it</span>
    # <span class="nv">from</span> <span class="nv">the</span> <span class="nv">current</span> <span class="nv">branch</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">necessary</span>
    <span class="nv">go</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="s">!f() { git checkout -b \</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="mh">$1</span>\<span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="s"> 2&gt; /dev/null || git checkout \</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="mh">$1</span>\<span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="s">; }; f</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Careful you don't mistype the branch name.</p>
<h2>Remote Utils</h2>
<p>Another useful git command is the remote command, so here are a few
remote aliases:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">r</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">remote</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">v</span>
    <span class="n">rv</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">remote</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">v</span>
    <span class="n">ra</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">remote</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">v</span>
</pre></div>


<h2>Commit Utils</h2>
<p>Sometimes you have changes that you've staged using <code>git add</code>, but you
want to see the changes that you've staged, before you commit them.</p>
<p>Normally you'd have to use the inconvenient <code>git diff --cached &lt;files&gt;</code>,
but this can be aliased to <code>cdiff</code>, so that you can use <code>git diff</code> to see
unstaged changes and <code>git cdiff</code> to see staged changes.</p>
<p>Even better, you can define the alias <code>g cd</code> to run <code>git cdiff</code>...!</p>
<p>Here's the relevant bit in the aliases section:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">cdiff</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">diff</span> <span class="c1">--cached</span>
    <span class="n">cd</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">diff</span> <span class="c1">--cached</span>
</pre></div>


<h3>Committing All Changes</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="o">#</span> <span class="k">Commit</span> <span class="k">all</span> <span class="n">changes</span>
    <span class="n">ca</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">git</span> <span class="k">add</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">A</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="n">git</span> <span class="k">commit</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">av</span>
</pre></div>


<h3>Fixing Commits</h3>
<p>Some common operations for repairing commit history before pushing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="o">#</span> <span class="n">Amend</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">currently</span> <span class="n">staged</span> <span class="n">files</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">latest</span> <span class="k">commit</span>
    <span class="n">amend</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">commit</span> <span class="c1">--amend --reuse-message=HEAD</span>

    <span class="o">#</span> <span class="n">Oops</span>
    <span class="n">fix</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">commit</span> <span class="c1">--amend --reuse-message=HEAD --edit</span>
</pre></div>


<h2>Miscellaneous Utils</h2>
<p>There are a few other actions that are useful to add to the aliases section
of the <code>~/.gitconfig</code>:</p>
<h3>Rebasing shortcuts</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="o">#</span> <span class="n">Interactive</span> <span class="n">rebase</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">given</span> <span class="nb">number</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">latest</span> <span class="n">commits</span>
    <span class="n">reb</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="ss">&quot;!r() { git rebase -i HEAD~$1; }; r&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<h3>Diff shortcuts</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    # <span class="k">Show</span> <span class="nv">the</span> <span class="nv">diff</span> <span class="nv">between</span> <span class="nv">the</span> <span class="nv">latest</span> <span class="nv">commit</span> <span class="nv">and</span> <span class="nv">the</span> <span class="nv">current</span> <span class="nv">state</span>
    <span class="nv">d</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="s">git diff-index --quiet HEAD -- || clear; git --no-pager diff --patch-with-stat</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>

    # `<span class="nv">git</span> <span class="nv">di</span> $<span class="nv">number</span>` <span class="nv">shows</span> <span class="nv">the</span> <span class="nv">diff</span> <span class="nv">between</span> <span class="nv">the</span> <span class="nv">state</span> `$<span class="nv">number</span>` <span class="nv">revisions</span> <span class="nv">ago</span> <span class="nv">and</span> <span class="nv">the</span> <span class="nv">current</span> <span class="nv">state</span>
    <span class="nv">di</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="s">d() { git diff --patch-with-stat HEAD~$1; }; git diff-index --quiet HEAD -- || clear; d</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<h3>Pull shortcuts</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="ss">&quot;!f() { git pull $1 $2; }; f&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<h3>Clone shortcuts</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="o">#</span> <span class="n">Clone</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">repository</span> <span class="k">including</span> <span class="k">all</span> <span class="n">submodules</span>
    <span class="k">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">clone</span> <span class="c1">--recursive</span>
</pre></div>


<h3>Contributor shortcuts</h3>
<p>This last one is convenient for getting a summary of contributors:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="o">#</span> <span class="n">List</span> <span class="n">contributors</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">number</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">commits</span>
    <span class="n">contributors</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">shortlog</span> <span class="c1">--summary --numbered</span>
</pre></div>


<p>An example for <a href="https://github.com/aws/chalice">https://github.com/aws/chalice</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ <span class="nb">cd</span> chalice/
$ g contributors
  <span class="m">1053</span>  James Saryerwinnie
   <span class="m">120</span>  John Carlyle

<h1>color section</h1>
<p>Make some nice beautiful colors that are easy to understand:</p>

<span class="s">    changed = green</span>
<span class="s">    untracked = cyan</span>
</pre></div>


<h1>url section</h1>
<p>This makes some Github-related URLs easier and shorter to type:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">[url &quot;git@github.com:&quot;]</span>

    <span class="na">insteadOf</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;gh:&quot;</span>
<span class="s">    pushInsteadOf = &quot;github:&quot;</span>
<span class="s">    pushInsteadOf = &quot;git://github.com/&quot;</span>

<span class="k">[url &quot;git@gist.github.com:&quot;]</span>

    <span class="na">insteadOf</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;gst:&quot;</span>
<span class="s">    pushInsteadOf = &quot;gist:&quot;</span>
<span class="s">    pushInsteadOf = &quot;git://gist.github.com/&quot;</span>

<span class="k">[url &quot;git://gist.github.com/&quot;]</span>

    <span class="na">insteadOf</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;gist:&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now, instead of</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git clone git@github.com:org-name/repo-name
</pre></div>


<p>you can do the much simpler</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ g c gh://org-name/repo-name
</pre></div>


<p>Voila! Start integrating these alises into your daily workflow,
and you'll find yourself using a lot fewer keystrokes!</p></div>
