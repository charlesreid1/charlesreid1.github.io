<h1>Summary</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make your commits small and atomic, and recombine them into
  larger commits later; it's easier to combine smaller commits
  than to split large commits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make use of <code>git add -p</code> and <code>git add -e</code> to stage
  changes selectively and atomically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make use of <code>git rebase</code> and <code>git cherry-pick</code> to edit your
  commits and assemble them in the order you want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once commits have been combine and the history is satisfactory,
  push to a remote to share the work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think about ordering your commits to "tell a story". (What that
  means will depend on the people you are collaborating with!)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>What is a commit</h1>
<p>Before we get into the good stuff, let's talk about the
anatomy of a git commit.</p>
<p>When you add files to your git repository, it's a two-step
process: <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code>. The first step <em>stages</em>
your changes, the second step memorializes those staged changes
into a commit that can now be shared with others by pushing it
to git remotes.</p>
<h2>git add</h2>
<p>It is important to know that git does not keep track of changes at
the file level, it keeps track of changes at the character/line level.</p>
<p>What that means is, when you modify a line in a file that is in your
git repository, and run <code>git add</code> to stage your change, git has created
an object under the hood called a <em>blob</em> to represent that one line change.</p>
<p>If you change two lines in two different parts of a file, and stage those
changes using <code>git add</code>, git will treat this as two separate changes, and
represent the changes with two different blobs.</p>
<h2>git commit</h2>
<p>As you use <code>git add</code> to prepare your changes, the changes are added to
a <em>staging area</em>. Think of this staging area as a draft commit. Each change
being added to the staging area changes how the commit will look. When the
changes are complete and the user runs <code>git commit</code>, it turns the staging
area into a real commit, creates the metadata, and calculates hashes.</p>
<p>When a commit is created, it receives a name, which is the hash of the
contents of the commit. The hash is computed from the contents of the
blobs, plus the metadata about the commit, plus the hash of the prior
commits. Changing a commit changes its hash, and will change the hashes
of all subsequent commits.</p>
<p>Commits in your local repository can be easily rewritten and edited, and
their hashes changed. A common workflow is to make many small commits,
and recombine them later.</p>
<p>Because the commit hash is how the commit is named, modifying commits
after you've shared them is bad practice and will create extra work for
your collaborators. For that reason, don't <code>git push</code> until you're ready
to share your work.</p>
<h2>git rebase</h2>
<p>The <code>git rebase</code> command allows you to edit your commit history. We will
cover some usage patterns in the sections below.</p>
<h2>git fetch and git pull</h2>
<p>Before pushing changes to the remote, first check if there have been any
commits since you began your branch.</p>
<h3>rebase, merge, branch, pass</h3>
<p>If a feature branch is created off of the master branch, and some time passes,
the feature branch base commit may grow far out of sync with the master branch.
(Note that <code>master</code> indicates the primary branch.)</p>
<p>This leaves the developer of the feature branch a few choices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>rebase</strong> - continue to rebase all commits on the feature branch from the
  original feature branch base commit onto the head commit of the master branch.</li>
<li>Pros: clean history, easy for one-branch-one-developer workflow</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: requires continual force-pushes, requires coordination between developers
    to prevent squashing others' work, not scalable, some people hate this method</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>merge</strong> - occasionally merge work from the master branch into the feature branch.</p>
</li>
<li>Pros: simple to understand, simple to carry out, low cognitive load</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: clutters PR review by mixing feature changes with merged changes, clutters the
    commit history</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>branch</strong> - by making heavy use of throwaway branches and integration branches,
  it is easier to test out how the integration of a feature branch based on an old
  commit on <code>master</code> will do when merging it in with a newer version of <code>master</code>.
  Use throwaway integration branches to test out merging the two branches together,
  testing its functionality, etc. You can also rebase or cherry pick commits onto
  the throwaway integration branch, and figure out how to arrange the commits on a
  branch to "rebuild" it into a working, mergeable branch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>pass</strong> - best combined with the branch approach mentioned above, the pass approach
  is to leave the branch history clean, avoid force-pushes, and rely on throwaway
  branches to test out merge strategies once the inevitable PR merge needs to happen.
  It can also be useful to wait for code reviews to finish, then create a merge commit
  to make the merge happen smoothly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>git push</h2>
<p>Once you run <code>git push</code>, all of the commits on the branch that you pushed
will end up on the remote, where others can access them. The purpose
of a <code>git push</code> is to share commits, so generally you don't push branches
until they are ready to share. This also allows more flexibility in crafting,
rewriting, and combining commits.</p>
<h2>force pushing</h2>
<p>If you pushed a branch (which is a collection of commits) to a remote,
and then you have edited those commits, you will run into a problem when
you try and <code>git push</code> the new, edited versions of the commits to the same
remote. The remote will detect that there are conflicting versions of
the branch and will reject the changes.</p>
<p>That's where <code>git push --force</code> comes in. The <code>--force</code> flag tells the
remote to discard its version of the branch and use the version of the
branch that you are pushing.</p>
<p>We will cover more about force pushing - when to do it, when not to, and
why some people hate it - in part 3 of this post. For now, we will only say
that you should not force push often, since you can risk deleting others' work
and creating additional confusion and work for all of your collaborators.</p>
<h1>Commit Workflow</h1>
<h2>Principles</h2>
<p>Here are some principles for your <code>git commit</code> workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Commit small changes often.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't sweat the commit messages - they can be fixed up later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Related - nobody will see your commits until you push your branch,
  so think of your branch as a scratch space. You have the ultimate
  freedom to use it however you want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Branches are easy to create, so make liberal use of branches!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be wary of force pushing, and of rewriting history.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Making Small Commits</h2>
<p>Two essential git commands to help with making small commits are
git add (patch mode) and git add (interactive mode).</p>
<h3>git add patch mode</h3>
<p>How to use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git add -p &lt;name-of-file&gt;
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>git add -p</code> command allows the user to interactively stage
individual changes made (in what is called patch mode). This means
users can stage certain changes for one commit, then stage other
changes for a different commit.</p>
<p>This solves the problem of making a long sequence of changes
to a single file that should be logically separated into
different steps. (For example, changing the <code>import</code> statements
versus changing the name of a variable throughout a file).</p>
<p>For example, suppose we have the following changes to a file named <code>doit.sh</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git diff doit.sh
diff --git a/doit.sh b/doit.sh
index 3b938a1..6c1aec8 <span class="m">100644</span>

<p>There are two related changes and one unrelated change, respectively.
We can split these changes into two commits using <code>git add -p doit.sh</code>,
which will walk through each change in the file and ask if we want to
stage it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git add -p doit.sh

<p>Now the two related changes are staged, and the unrelated change is not staged.
This is reflected in <code>git status</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of <span class="s1">&#39;gh/master&#39;</span> by <span class="m">2</span> commits.
  <span class="o">(</span>use <span class="s2">&quot;git push&quot;</span> to publish your <span class="nb">local</span> commits<span class="o">)</span>

Changes to be committed:
  <span class="o">(</span>use <span class="s2">&quot;git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;...&quot;</span> to unstage<span class="o">)</span>
    modified:   doit.sh

Changes not staged <span class="k">for</span> commit:
  <span class="o">(</span>use <span class="s2">&quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot;</span> to update what will be committed<span class="o">)</span>
  <span class="o">(</span>use <span class="s2">&quot;git restore &lt;file&gt;...&quot;</span> to discard changes in working directory<span class="o">)</span>
    modified:   doit.sh
</pre></div>


<p>Now <code>git commit</code> will commit only the staged portions.</p>
<p>Do not provide any filenames to <code>git commit</code>, so that git will only commit the staged changes.</p>
<p>To use this in your workflow, think about how you can group different changes together into
different commits. If you get a portion of a feature working, you can commit the changes in
groups so that related changes get committed together.</p>
<p>Also remember that if your commit history ends up being excessively long or overly detailed,
you can always examine what changes different commits made with <code>git diff</code>, and reorder them
with <code>git cherry-pick</code> or modify/combine them with <code>git rebase</code>.</p>
<h3>git add editor mode</h3>
<p>How to use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git add -e &lt;name-of-file&gt;
</pre></div>


<p>Like the interactive patch mode, <code>git add -e</code> allows you to selectively
stage certain changes in a file. But it's much better for keyboard jockeys
and those that love their text editor, because you can choose which changes
to stage or not using the text editor.</p>
<p>A sidebar:</p>
<p>If you have not yet set the text editor that git uses, you should
do that now. Modify your git configuration with this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git config --global core.editor vim
</pre></div>


<p>Alternatively, put the following in your <code>~/.gitconfig</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">[core]</span>
    <span class="na">editor</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">vim</span>
</pre></div>


<p>(Or, you know, whatever your text editor of choice is.)</p>
<p>End of sidebar.</p>
<p>When you pass the <code>-e</code> flag to git add, it will open a new editor window with the full diff:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gh">diff --git a/doit.sh b/doit.sh</span>

<p><strong>Editing this file requires some care!</strong></p>
<p>Fortunately there is a section in the documentation for
<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add">git add</a> called
<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add#_editing_patches">Editing Patches</a>.</p>
<p>Two things to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lines starting with <code>+</code> indicate new, added content. To prevent this
  content from being added, delete the line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lines starting with <code>-</code> indicate removed content. To keep this content,
  replace <code>-</code> with a space (<code></code>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you are finished, make sure you review the changes that are staged,
particularly if this is the first time seeing patch files or the diff
syntax.</p>
<h2>Modifying Commits</h2>
<p>There is always some reason or another to modify the commit history of a repository -
perhaps someone's work was lost, or the wrong issue or pull request number was referenced,
or a username was misspelled.</p>
<p>You can always modify a commit, but it will also modify every commit that came after it.
Think of it like replaying the changes recorded in each commit onto the new branch. The
contents of each commit changes slightly, so the hash (the name) of every commit changes.</p>
<h3>git rebase</h3>
<p>To do a git rebase, an interactive rebase (the <code>-i</code> flag) is recommended.</p>
<p>The rebase action takes two commits, and will replay the commits.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The first commit given (the start commit) is <em>not</em> included
in the rebase. To include it, add <code>~1</code> to the start commit. (For example,
<code>0a1b2c3d~1</code> refers to the commit before commit <code>0a1b2c3d</code>.</p>
<h4>rebasing a range of commits</h4>
<p>To rebase from the start commit hash to the end commit hash, and include the start commit
in the rebase, the rebase command is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git rebase -i START_COMMIT_HASH~1 END_COMMIT_HASH
</pre></div>


<p>This does not indicate a destination branch. The default behavior is for the branch to move
and the new pile of commits to retain the same branch name.</p>
<h4>rebasing onto another branch</h4>
<p>To rebase a range of commits onto a different branch (for example, onto a <code>master</code> branch
that has the latest changes from the remote), use the <code>--onto</code> flag:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git rebase -i START_COMMIT_HASH END_COMMIT_HASH --onto TARGET_BRANCH
</pre></div>


<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The above rebase commands will leave your repo in a headless state - unlike
the behavior of the prior command, the branch label will not move with you to the new pile
of commits.</p>
<p>Run <code>git checkout -b &lt;branchname&gt;</code> to give your new rebased branch a meaningful name.
This creates a branch wherever HEAD is, which is pointing to the top of the pile of rebased
commits.</p>
<p>If you want the old branch label to move to the new pile of commits, it requires a bit of branch
housekeeping - you have to delete the old branch, then create a new branch from where
HEAD is (the end of the rebase), then check out that branch.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git branch -D &lt;branchname&gt; &amp;&amp; git checkout -b &lt;branchname&gt;
</pre></div>


<h2>Rearranging Commits</h2>
<p>Where rebasing allows for editing commits en masse, cherry picking allows the changes made in
individual commits to be applied anywhere - including other branches. This makes the atomic
commit principle from the beginning of this post much easier - groups of related commits that
happened out of order can be rearranged by cherry picking them onto a new branch, and the new
branch is a better "story".</p>
<h2>Combining Commits</h2>
<p>The cherry pick operation can also be combined with a rebase - once multiple small commits are
arranged together chronologically, a git rebase operation enables squashing those tiny commits
into a small number of larger commits, all carrying related changes.</p></div>

<h1>Source</h1>
<p>Most of the good stuff is from
<a href="https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles">https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles</a>!</p>
<h1>user section</h1>
<p>Start off easy - here's how you set your email and name for commits:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">[user]</span>
    <span class="na">email</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">foo@bar.com</span>
<span class="s">    name = Foo Bar</span>
</pre></div>


<h1>Bash Aliases</h1>
<h2>The Best One Letter Alias Ever</h2>
<p>Start supercharging how you use git by creating a one-letter alias.</p>
<p>Add this to your <code>~/.bashrc</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>alias g=&quot;git&quot;
</pre></div>


<p>You're already saving yourself a bunch of keystrokes, and we're just getting started!</p>
<h2>Ending Bad Habits</h2>
<p>This is a nice trick for getting yourself out of bad habits.
My first time using a "sophisticated" branch worklow in git
(i.e., not just committing and pushing to master all the time),
I got in trouble for committing directly to master with a
<code>git push origin master</code> (instead of making a feature branch
and opening a pull request).</p>
<p>To get myself out of the habit of typing <code>git push origin master</code>,
I wanted to map it to an alias that told me no. I did that by
defining <code>git</code> to be a bash function (this works because functions
take precedence over a binary named <code>git</code> on your path).</p>
<p>The git function checks the arguments that are passed to it.
If the arguments are <code>push origin master</code>, it means I'm typing
<code>git push origin master</code>, and I get a slap on the wrist.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it passes the arguments through to the <code>git</code> binary.</p>
<p>You can also put this in <code>~/.bashrc</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[[</span> <span class="nv">$@</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;push origin master&quot;</span> <span class="o">]]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>
        <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;nope&quot;</span>
    <span class="k">else</span>
        <span class="nb">command</span> git <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$@</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
    <span class="k">fi</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>


<h1>alias section</h1>
<p>In the <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file, aliases specific to git can be
defined in a section beginning with alias.</p>
<h2>Log Utils</h2>
<p>Let's start with some utilities for viewing git logs.</p>
<p>(You can never have too many ways to look at a git log.)</p>
<p>Note that we'll assume the alias bit in the following git config excerpts.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">[alias]</span>
    <span class="c1"># courtesy of https://stackoverflow.com/a/34467298</span>
    <span class="na">lg</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">!&quot;git lg1&quot;</span>
<span class="s">    lg1 = !&quot;git lg1-specific --all&quot;</span>
<span class="s">    lg2 = !&quot;git lg2-specific --all&quot;</span>
<span class="s">    lg3 = !&quot;git lg3-specific --all&quot;</span>

    <span class="na">lg1-specific</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">log --graph --abbrev-commit --decorate --format=format:&#39;%C(bold blue)%h%C(reset) - %C(bold green)(%ar)%C(reset) %C(white)%s%C(reset) %C(dim white)- %an%C(reset)%C(auto)%d%C(reset)&#39;</span>
<span class="s">    lg2-specific = log --graph --abbrev-commit --decorate --format=format:&#39;%C(bold blue)%h%C(reset) - %C(bold cyan)%aD%C(reset) %C(bold green)(%ar)%C(reset)%C(auto)%d%C(reset)%n&#39;&#39;          %C(white)%s%C(reset) %C(dim white)- %an%C(reset)&#39;</span>
<span class="s">    lg3-specific = log --graph --abbrev-commit --decorate --format=format:&#39;%C(bold blue)%h%C(reset) - %C(bold cyan)%aD%C(reset) %C(bold green)(%ar)%C(reset) %C(bold cyan)(committed: %cD)%C(reset) %C(auto)%d%C(reset)%n&#39;&#39;          %C(white)%s%C(reset)%n&#39;&#39;          %C(dim white)- %an &lt;%ae&gt; %C(reset) %C(dim white)(committer: %cn &lt;%ce&gt;)%C(reset)&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>git lgX</code> shortcuts give similar views of the log, but with increasing vertical spacing.
<code>git lg1</code> is the most compact, while <code>git lg3</code> is the most comfortable to read, as far as vertical whitespace.
Same with the <code>-specific</code> commands.</p>
<p>This is one more nice short log command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    # View abbreviated SHA, description, and history graph of the latest 20 commits
    l = log --pretty=oneline -n 20 --graph --abbrev-commit
</pre></div>


<p>Remember to use this with the <code>g</code> alias for super short log:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ g l
* 4357b28 <span class="o">(</span>HEAD -&gt; <span class="nb">source</span><span class="o">)</span> update mocking aws post

...
</pre></div>


<h2>Status Utils</h2>
<p>The git status command is one of my most frequently used commands, so I made a few shortcuts:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    # View the current working tree status using the short format
    s = status -s
    ss = status
</pre></div>


<p>This makes checking the short or long status of a git repo easy:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ g s
AM pelican/content/git-workflows-1-config.md
AM pelican/content/git-workflows-2-teams.md

$ g ss
On branch <span class="nb">source</span>
Your branch is ahead of <span class="s1">&#39;gh/source&#39;</span> by <span class="m">1</span> commit.
  <span class="o">(</span>use <span class="s2">&quot;git push&quot;</span> to publish your <span class="nb">local</span> commits<span class="o">)</span>

Changes to be committed:
  <span class="o">(</span>use <span class="s2">&quot;git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;...&quot;</span> to unstage<span class="o">)</span>
    new file:   pelican/content/git-workflows-1-config.md
    new file:   pelican/content/git-workflows-2-teams.md

Changes not staged <span class="k">for</span> commit:
  <span class="o">(</span>use <span class="s2">&quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot;</span> to update what will be committed<span class="o">)</span>
  <span class="o">(</span>use <span class="s2">&quot;git restore &lt;file&gt;...&quot;</span> to discard changes in working directory<span class="o">)</span>
    modified:   pelican/content/git-workflows-1-config.md
    modified:   pelican/content/git-workflows-2-teams.md
</pre></div>


<h2>Fetching</h2>
<p>Fetching is handy to do, since it just fetches changes from a remote and doesn't actually
change anything or try to merge anything (unlike a <code>git pull</code> command).</p>
<p>The most useful fetch command (<code>git fetch --all</code>) is aliased to <code>g f</code> with the following
bit in the aliases section of the <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    f = fetch --all
</pre></div>


<h2>Branch Utils</h2>
<p>The only command I might use more than the status command are branch commands,
so here are several branch aliases:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    b = branch -v
    bv = branch -v
    bb = branch -v

    ba = branch -a
    bb = branch -v -a
</pre></div>


<p>In a similar way, you can get a summary view using <code>g b</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ g b
  master 4c828cd <span class="o">[</span>behind <span class="m">84</span><span class="o">]</span> update with awsome day notes
* <span class="nb">source</span> b18adfd add two git workflow posts

$ g b
  master 940ee98 update mocking post
* <span class="nb">source</span> b18adfd add two git workflow posts
</pre></div>


<p>and a little bit more information with <code>g bb</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ g bb
  master            940ee98 update mocking post
* <span class="nb">source</span>            b18adfd add two git workflow posts
  remotes/gh/HEAD   -&gt; gh/source
  remotes/gh/master 940ee98 update mocking post
  remotes/gh/source b18adfd add two git workflow posts
</pre></div>


<h3>Branch and Checkout</h3>
<p>Sometimes if you are creaing a branch with a long branch name, it can be
inconvenient to have to first create the branch with <code>git branch &lt;branch-name&gt;</code>
and then check it out with <code>git checkout &lt;branch-name&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>To resolve this you can define a <code>git go</code> alias that creates the branch and
then switches to that branch:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    # Switch to a branch, creating it
    # from the current branch if necessary
    go = &quot;!f() { git checkout -b \&quot;$1\&quot; 2&gt; /dev/null || git checkout \&quot;$1\&quot;; }; f&quot;
</pre></div>


<p>Careful you don't mistype the branch name.</p>
<h2>Remote Utils</h2>
<p>Another useful git command is the remote command, so here are a few
remote aliases:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    r = remote -v
    rv = remote -v
    ra = remote -v
</pre></div>


<h2>Commit Utils</h2>
<p>Sometimes you have changes that you've staged using <code>git add</code>, but you
want to see the changes that you've staged, before you commit them.</p>
<p>Normally you'd have to use the inconvenient <code>git diff --cached &lt;files&gt;</code>,
but this can be aliased to <code>cdiff</code>, so that you can use <code>git diff</code> to see
unstaged changes and <code>git cdiff</code> to see staged changes.</p>
<p>Even better, you can define the alias <code>g cd</code> to run <code>git cdiff</code>...!</p>
<p>Here's the relevant bit in the aliases section:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    cdiff = diff --cached
    cd = diff --cached
</pre></div>


<h3>Committing All Changes</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    # Commit all changes
    ca = !git add -A &amp;&amp; git commit -av
</pre></div>


<h3>Fixing Commits</h3>
<p>Some common operations for repairing commit history before pushing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    # Amend the currently staged files to the latest commit
    amend = commit --amend --reuse-message=HEAD

    # Oops
    fix = commit --amend --reuse-message=HEAD --edit
</pre></div>


<h2>Miscellaneous Utils</h2>
<p>There are a few other actions that are useful to add to the aliases section
of the <code>~/.gitconfig</code>:</p>
<h3>Rebasing shortcuts</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    # Interactive rebase with the given number of latest commits
    reb = &quot;!r() { git rebase -i HEAD~$1; }; r&quot;
</pre></div>


<h3>Diff shortcuts</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    # Show the diff between the latest commit and the current state
    d = !&quot;git diff-index --quiet HEAD -- || clear; git --no-pager diff --patch-with-stat&quot;

    # `git di $number` shows the diff between the state `$number` revisions ago and the current state
    di = !&quot;d() { git diff --patch-with-stat HEAD~$1; }; git diff-index --quiet HEAD -- || clear; d&quot;
</pre></div>


<h3>Pull shortcuts</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    p = &quot;!f() { git pull $1 $2; }; f&quot;
</pre></div>


<h3>Clone shortcuts</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    # Clone a repository including all submodules
    c = clone --recursive
</pre></div>


<h3>Contributor shortcuts</h3>
<p>This last one is convenient for getting a summary of contributors:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    # List contributors with number of commits
    contributors = shortlog --summary --numbered
</pre></div>


<p>An example for <a href="https://github.com/aws/chalice">https://github.com/aws/chalice</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ <span class="nb">cd</span> chalice/
$ g contributors
  <span class="m">1053</span>  James Saryerwinnie
   <span class="m">120</span>  John Carlyle
    <span class="m">94</span>  stealthycoin
    <span class="m">42</span>  kyleknap
    <span class="m">35</span>  jcarlyl
    <span class="m">19</span>  Kyle Knapp
    <span class="m">12</span>  Atharva Chauthaiwale
</pre></div>


<h1>core section</h1>
<p>Because it's the best text editor:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">[core]</span>
    <span class="na">editor</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">vim</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I have some other stuff I've collected, many of them from
<a href="https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles">https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    # Use custom `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes`
    excludesfile = ~/.gitignore
    attributesfile = ~/.gitattributes

    # Treat spaces before tabs and all kinds of trailing whitespace as an error

    # [default] space-before-tab: looks for spaces before tabs at the beginning of a line

    <span class="c1"># Use colors in Git commands that are capable of colored output when</span>
    <span class="c1"># outputting to the terminal. (This is the default setting in Git ≥ 1.8.4.)</span>

<span class="s">    changed = green</span>
<span class="s">    untracked = cyan</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This makes some Github-related URLs easier and shorter to type:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">[url &quot;git@github.com:&quot;]</span>

<span class="s">    pushInsteadOf = &quot;git://gist.github.com/&quot;</span>

<span class="k">[url &quot;git://gist.github.com/&quot;]</span>

    <span class="na">insteadOf</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;gist:&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now, instead of</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git clone git@github.com:org-name/repo-name
</pre></div>


<p>you can do the much simpler</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ g c gh://org-name/repo-name
</pre></div>


<p>Voila! Start integrating these alises into your daily workflow,
and you'll find yourself using a lot fewer keystrokes!</p></div>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This post covers a technique for mocking AWS in unit tests so that you can test functionality that normally
requires API calls and handling responses, by mocking those responses instead of making actual API calls.</p>
<h2>A Simple Example: Mocking API Responses</h2>
<h3>The Genuine AWS Call</h3>
<p>Let's start with an example of an AWS API call. Here's how our program will be structured:
start with a driver <code>lister.py</code> that creates an AWS secrets manager client and defines a 
function to list secrets using the secrets manager client, then a test for it in <code>test_lister.py</code>
that mocks the AWS call.</p>
<p>This example is simple and uses just one function, <code>list_secrets()</code>,
which returns a JSON response that looks something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>{
  &quot;SecretList&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;ARN&quot;: &quot;arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:000000000000:secret:prefix/secret1-abc123&quot;,
      &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;prefix/es_source_ip&quot;,
      &quot;LastChangedDate&quot;: &quot;2019-09-23 17:29:16.267000-07:00&quot;,
      &quot;LastAccessedDate&quot;: &quot;2019-09-23 17:00:00-07:00&quot;,
      &quot;SecretVersionsToStages&quot;: {
        &quot;658c3b41-0806-48b9-b05d-ea7dc2dbf237&quot;: [
          &quot;AWSCURRENT&quot;
        ],
        &quot;f37ccfe2-16e0-4305-a250-ef89d2c47ece&quot;: [
          &quot;AWSPREVIOUS&quot;
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      &quot;ARN&quot;: &quot;arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:000000000000:secret:prefix/secret2-def789&quot;,
      &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;prefix/secret2&quot;,
      &quot;LastChangedDate&quot;: &quot;2019-09-22 17:05:01.431000-07:00&quot;,
      &quot;LastAccessedDate&quot;: &quot;2019-09-22 17:00:00-07:00&quot;,
      &quot;SecretVersionsToStages&quot;: {
        &quot;95AE5F8B-34E7-4EDF-A672-9E3AF1A4732E&quot;: [
          &quot;AWSCURRENT&quot;
        ],
        &quot;F29E224A-BC03-4780-B64E-EA666B99D952&quot;: [
          &quot;AWSPREVIOUS&quot;
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
</pre></div>


<p>Using the secrets manager API:</p>
<p><strong><code>lister.py</code></strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">boto3</span>

<span class="n">sm_client</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">boto3</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">client</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;secretsmanager&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_secret_names</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sm_client</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">list_secrets</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">secret</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">s</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;SecretList&#39;</span><span class="p">]:</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Name&#39;</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">secret</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="s1">&#39;LastAccessedDate&#39;</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">secret</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="s2">&quot;Secret Name: {secret[&#39;Name&#39;]} (last accessed: {secret[&#39;LastAccessedDate&#39;]})&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="s2">&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">print_secret_names</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If we run this file, we'll see a list of secrets in the real secrets manager -
that is, the secrets manager that is linked to the boto credentials in <code>~/.aws</code>,
so the secrets we see are the actual secrets in the secret manager:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ python lister.py
Secret Name: prefix/secret1 <span class="o">(</span>last accessed: <span class="m">2019</span>-09-23 <span class="m">17</span>:00:00-07:00<span class="o">)</span>
Secret Name: prefix/secret2 <span class="o">(</span>last accessed: <span class="m">2019</span>-09-23 <span class="m">17</span>:00:00-07:00<span class="o">)</span>
Secret Name: prefix/secret3 <span class="o">(</span>last accessed: <span class="m">2019</span>-09-23 <span class="m">17</span>:00:00-07:00<span class="o">)</span>
</pre></div>


<h3>The Mocked AWS Call</h3>
<p>It is important to only mock the functionality we need.
We should mock the returned JSON, but only the <code>Name</code>
and <code>LastAccessedDate</code> fields.</p>
<p>To mock the call to <code>list_secrets()</code>, we start by importing
<code>mock</code> from <code>unittest</code>. Then we import the file that has the
function we want to test. We also import any other modules
we need.</p>
<p>Next, we are mocking a call to a method of an object,
which we can do by creating a context via <code>with mock.patch()</code>
(and passing it a string with the name of the object we want
to mock, or patch).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">unittest</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">unittest</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">mock</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">lister</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">datetime</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">TestMo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">unittest</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">TestCase</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">patch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;mo.sm_client&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">sm</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="o">...</span>
            <span class="n">sm_client</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">list_secrets</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">MagicMock</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="o">...</span> <span class="p">)</span>
            <span class="o">...</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Any calls made to <code>sm_client</code> in the <code>mo</code> module will be mocked
using the <code>mock.MagicMock</code> object that we define in the context,
so we craft the response we want before we call the method we 
want to test (which in turn will call <code>sm_client.list_secrets()</code>).</p>
<p>The full version of the test looks like this:</p>
<p><strong><code>test_lister.py</code></strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">unittest</span>

<p>When the test file is run via Python, we see the fake secrets:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ python test_lister.py
